1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew on GA-89 Amsterdam to Jakarta March 2024. From being picked up from my hotel in Amsterdam to being dropped off at my home in Jakarta it was a seamless and wonderful experience. Garuda also provides access to the VIP Lounge in Schiphol airport, and this means that all security and immigration formalities are completed in the lounge avoiding long queues. The flight itself was outstanding as I was lucky to have the same crew as on the outbound flight i.e. Yudirsyan, Renny, Chef Gia and Affiriyani and again they were very welcoming and gave an outstanding service throughout the flight. They even catered to my very early breakfast request. I put the service provided on the ground and in the air at 11/10.

4,"Not Verified | The ground experience is terrible, the Garuda international lounge is dirty. The showers are not cleaned between 2 passengers. The boarding experience is chaotic. Just before boarding the plane we are asked to leave our water bottles at the gate (which does not make any sense as we've already been through security). The cabin crew is unfriendly, the seats and toilets are dirty and the footrest is uncomfortable as it eats your legroom. No comment or excuses from the crew after a 1 hour delay.

As it was a late-night flight the lounge was not that busy, however there were sufficient snacks, food and hot and colds drinks available. Boarding was orderly; however, it seems that Garuda lets people board with quite a lot of hand luggage, and I saw some large size cases as well which I believe should have been checked in as they took up too much space in the overhead storage bins. It was an overnight flight; however, the seats were reasonably comfortable. The cabin crew was efficient and welcoming, after takeoff they came around and offered a small meal and some hot & drinks.

Eventually when I finished the check in process, I was given a voucher to access the TIAT Lounge, however upon entering the lounge I was informed that I would have to wait outside as the lounge was full. Therefore, I decided to use my AMEX Card which allows me access to the SKY lounge. When it came time to board, both Business and Economy class passengers were boarded at the same time, however this did not lead to any delays in boarding. When entering the aircraft, the cabin crew gave a warm welcome.

We arrived in Jakarta on schedule and when the aircraft door was opened, I was met by Vianda from the Garuda PSA Team who escorted me through immigration, baggage collect, customs and assisted me in getting a taxi. Thank you very much Vianda. My conclusion is that the onboard flight and ground services in Jakarta were outstanding, however these we let down by the long check in times and lack of lounge access in Tokyo Haneda airport.

The salmon was well presented and tasted savory. I then chose to rest, and the cabin crew made up the bed. I had a good rest, and when I woke up the cabin crew were on hand to serve snacks and hot and cold drinks. With less than three hours to landing the onboard chef offered a cooked breakfast. I chose an omelet which was garnished with sausage, tomatoes etc. Anoth great meal. The service from boarding in Amsterdam to landing in Jakarta was exceptional from the team made up of Ely Siswanto, Maria Dewi, Desti and Chef Erwin.

22,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently enjoyed a pleasure flight, and I must say that the service truly stood out as the most remarkable aspect of my journey. It's no surprise that Garuda Indonesia was awarded as The World's Best Cabin Crew. The attentiveness and professionalism of cabin crew made the experience enjoyable and memorable. Starting with the positive aspects, the welcome drink and bottle of water provided on the ground were appreciated. However, including a small sweet treat, such as a piece of candy or some snacks, would have added a delightful touch to the welcome service. On this flight, I requested a seafood meal. The first service commenced approximately 25 minutes after take-off, during which a starter of salmon tart was served. Before the lights were turned out, which was approximately an hour after take-off, the second service began. I received a tuna sandwich as a light snack or an in-between course. One of the cabin crew accidentally offered me a regular meal, and I opted for the chicken pie, resulting in my receiving two snacks. Despite this, it enhanced my dining experience satisfaction. In terms of the meal schedule, I suggest serving a hot meal during the light snack or in-between course service, not just during breakfast or the pre-landing meal. This adjustment would provide passengers with a satisfying dinner option and contribute to a more comfortable journey pace. Approximately halfway through the journey, juice service was provided. Integrating the light snack or in-between course during the juice service, midway through the flight, could better align with passengers' hunger levels and create a more seamless dining experience. About an hour and 50 minutes prior to landing, breakfast or a pre-landing meal was served, which consisted of appetizers and a hot meal.

25,"✅ Trip Verified |   The service truly stood out as the most remarkable aspect of my journey.  The attentiveness and professionalism of cabin crew made the experience enjoyable and memorable. Upon taking my seat, the crew handed me a warm towel and offered a welcome drink. I chose a glass of champagne. Additionally, a bottle of water and amenity kits were placed on my seat. The first service included a snack (mixed nuts), which I received about 25 minutes after take-off. During the flight, I requested a special seafood meal. The second service (entree) commenced approximately an hour after take-off, consisting of king prawns with vermicelli noodles and mixed veggies. A bread roll and butter were also served on the entree tray. A suggestion for improvement is for Garuda to use pure butter instead of canola spread. The third service (main course) was served around 2 hours after take-off, featuring a hot meal of rice with sweet & sour seafood mix and cap cay. A dessert, mango pudding, was also included on the main course tray. I strongly recommend serving the dessert separately from the main course, while placing the bread on the entree tray and the side dishes on the main course tray. This approach allows passengers to fully savor each dish, enhancing the overall dining experience on your flights. After finishing the main course, a crew member offered me tea/coffee while I enjoyed the dessert. I opted for a cup of tea, which came with a mini chocolate bar. Approximately 2-3 hours before landing, sweet and savory snacks were offered, along with a beverage service. An hour prior to landing, a pre-landing snack and a final beverage service were served. The snack consisted of a salmon & cucumber sandwich with seaweed-flavored chips. Another area for improvement is the amenity kits. The amenity kits included: - A dental kit with a toothbrush and toothpaste. - Earplugs and an eye mask for a good night's sleep. - Plush socks and a cozy, high-quality blanket. - A curated selection of magazines and a tablet loaded with the latest movies and TV shows.

71,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I flew on Garuda Indonesia on GA089 from Amsterdam to Jakarta on June 25th, 2022. Garuda Indonesia informed us one day prior to check-in that we should go directly the VIP Center at Schiphol airport and that they would handle all our check-in requirements. This turned out to be outstanding as it was seamless from entering the VIP center until they took us to board the plane and avoided all the long queues going through security. This was a great service that Garuda afforded us and was much appreciated. After takeoff were we provided with a selection of meals, when the food arrived as each was prepared by the Chef onboard it was very well presented and tasted even better. We had two full meals onboard and the cabin crew were available and kept coming around asking if we need anything else. The cabin crew were every attentive to me, my wife and two children. Nothing was able bother for them and they always greeted us with a re-assuring heart warming smile. We had a minor problem with our IFE system in two seat, however we had been informed prior to boarding, however this was not an issue as we always bring our own Laptops/iPads etc. I would rate the overall service as excellent and would like to thank the cabin crew for their help and assistance to me and my family, they certainly made us feel at home.

73,"✅ Trip Verified | Jakarta CGK to Manado on board GA600. Frankly, if it was not for the service aspect of this flight, I would've given this flight a 6/10 max. The service itself was the boosting factor of this flight. The check-in staff at Jakarta was fast, friendly, and efficient so all of us were able to check in real fast despite the crowds flocking each check-in counter. Boarding was orderly despite stumbling a bit on the jet bridge - and upon boarding the plane, I spotted several product issues: the cabin was clean but was kept at a high temperature during boarding, the windows and the right wing of the airplane were undermaintained for so long that I was barely able to see the window clearly and the paintings to peel off, and the headrest of my seat had shrunken to the point that I felt like I was leaning against a piece of metal. Adding insult to injury, the in-flight entertainment experienced a major downgrade - no more live TV shows, no more games, and my headphone jack was nearing its breaking point. The selections were excellent if this flight was taken in 2018, but they were severely outdated by 2022 standards. Its responsiveness was not any better. The aircraft took off late, and we queued for a very long time at the taxiway with a scorching hot temperature inside the cabin. At this point, I was already about to give this flight a 4/10 - but then, the crews and the meal saved the day, both adding 2 points each. The crews were extremely friendly, polite, and proactive. It all started when they escorted me from the seat, and even during disembarking, they were still in a happy and energetic mood. They apologized when they forgot my order. On this 3-hour flight, they also proved that they're still above anyone else by serving not one, but two meals. The first one was a grilled fish with rice and vegetables, while the second one was a piece of strawberry bread. We were also given two bottles of drinks - a bottle of water and a bottle of tea, with other options still available upon request. Overall, this flight was salvaged by the service aspects of the flight. Had the services been as bad as the product, I wouldn't have given this flight an 8/10. Garuda really should consider balancing its service and its product. I know that they're experiencing a hard time nowadays, but who knows that the act of balancing service and product can save Garuda. This flight was a true representation of the following statement: ""A+ grade service with a B- grade product"".",2022-06-06,jakarta cgk manado board ga600 frankly service aspect flight wouldve give flight 610 max service boost factor flight checkin staff jakarta fast friendly efficient us able check real fast despite crowd flock checkin counter boarding orderly despite stumble bit jet bridge upon boarding plane spot several product issue cabin clean kept high temperature boarding window right wing airplane undermaintained long barely able see window clearly painting peel headrest seat shrunken point felt like lean piece metal add insult injury inflight entertainment experienced major downgrade live tv show game headphone jack near break point selection excellent flight take 2018 severely outdated 2022 standard responsiveness well aircraft take late queue long time taxiway scorch hot temperature inside cabin point already give flight 410 crew meal save day add 2 point crew extremely friendly polite proactive start escort seat even disembark still happy energetic mood apologize forgot order 3hour flight also prove theyre still anyone else serve one two meal first one grill fish rice vegetable second one piece strawberry bread also give two bottle drink bottle water bottle tea option still available upon request overall flight salvage service aspect flight service bad product wouldnt give flight 810 garuda really consider balance service product know theyre experience hard time nowadays know act balance service product save garuda flight true representation follow statement grade service b grade product,Positive

76,"✅ Trip Verified | Overjoyed about the chance to fly GA in their A330-900neo (DPS-CGK), few days prior to departure however, the aircraft is changed into B777-300-ER. Check in at GA flight business class always done at its class, a dedicated check in lounge. One concern on flight GA088 to AMS was, there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on. What I found worse was when the cabin crews walked past those passengers and did not notice and did not give any warning. Once I thought perhaps those passengers just forgot to have their mask on, but no. Afterwards, I went to the in-charge crews in business class with an angry voice, to address my concern as to why they let such things happen in corona times. Although all GA cabin crews are vaccinated against Covid-19, they must have been more alert with the onboard situation like on any other airlines I have flown with. It makes me wonder, is it the lack of English of the crews or just an ignorance? I have written a few good reviews about GA flights, but not this time. They announced that all passengers must sit according to seat number on the boarding pass, but this is yet another issue. I had to sit in one seat far away from my travel companion because of the social distancing, but when one asked to move seat to the empty seat between us, it was allowed by the crew.

77,"✅ Trip Verified | Garuda Indonesia GA89. Second time flying their B777 route AMS-CGK and vise versa. Flying during pandemic doesn't stop the cabin crew to provide their best service as always. Helpful, sincere, friendly and attentive, this is how I describe GA cabin crew. Meals served as always, course by course as if you are experiencing an A'la Carte dining. Unlike other airlines that decided to serve their meals in a box and cut services from usual, but not in GA. Covid-19 measurement is nicely done, all crews wearing mask and hand gloves. There is no unnecessary attributes. Business class lavatories are huge in comparison with KLM's I flew weeks ago. Seats comes in 1-2-1 configurations while many airlines are still on 2-2-2 or even 2-3-2. Social distance is well practiced on board which is the most important case nowadays.

78,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denpasar Bali to Bandung on 10 January 2021 as part of family trip to SE Asia. A new government requirement of a 2x24 hours validity Rapid Antigen test or 3x24 hours validity PCR test before flying forced us to get a RA test the day before. We have to validate the test results prior to check in and shows the validated documents at Garuda check in desk. We shopped a lot in Bali so we were overweight more than the allowance (44 lbs/20 kg per person) and have to pay for excess baggage at another booth, but then all our luggage were tagged as priority due to the excess baggage payment. The aircraft for this trip is a 10 year old B738 (PK-GFA) that is still in good shape. Boarding was done a few minutes early than expected, with Business Class passengers boarding first and then all Economy passengers. The airplane was clean but we still use our Clorox wipes to clean the tray table, armrest, seatbelts and screen when we got to our seat. The seats are spacious, legroom more than enough and the entertainment screen and its content is very decent for this 1.5 hours flight. We used the provided 2-prong headphones, since our wireless transmitter that connects to bluetooth headset is using a single 3.5"" jack. We were given a snack box with pastries and granola bar for this short flight, and drinks from the drink cart. Just like the Garuda flight a few days before, the FAs in this flight were very courteous, polite, helpful and cheerful when attending to their passengers. GA still have the best FA compared to other airlines in the world! Our flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and we arrived around 32 minutes ahead of schedule. Our luggage, having the priority tags, were among the first ones being unloaded from the aircraft to the Business Class luggage arrival area, ahead of the other luggage that have to go to the regular conveyor belt. Great job by Garuda ground handling! Garuda Indonesia has kept their service level consistently high, and I can see why they are one of the few airlines that have 5 stars rating. Even for a short flight in Economy we were given a great service and one can wonder how would it be for Garuda's long haul flights.

79,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Denpasar BaliS on 06 January 2021 as part of Family trip to SE Asia. Bali requires a valid PCR Test to enter and we were told to validate our papers at a validation desk at the airport before we can even check-in. Check in was done really quick. We waited at a gate area where there were 3 other airplanes were parked so it was quite crowded and only after other flights took off we were able to get some seats close to the gate. The boarding was done old style, Business class first then Economy all at the same time. However they did not announce to prepare the PCR Test to show at the gate, so after we showed them our passports I have to fish for the PCR Test papers from my rolling bag for the gate agent when we were already at the gate and she asked for it. Or perhaps she just did it randomly because we're not locals, I don't know. The airplane is a 9 year old B738 (PK-GFS) that is still in good condition and clean, however we still sanitize the tray table, seatbelts, screen and armrest with Clorox wipes. The seats are large with ample legroom, and the touch screen even though smaller but still very bright and watchable. They do not have a large selection of movies and music available but more than enough for this short 1.5 hours flight. They still use the two-prong jack so we cannot use our wireless transmitter (3.5"" jack) and bluetooth headphones, but have to use the provided free headphones. The FAs were very courteous and polite, they are super friendly and helpful, and also cheerful in their disposition when interacting with passengers. No wonder GA FA's won awards years in a row for being the best FA in the world! Even for this short flight we got a snack box with savory pastry, cake and a granola bar, and a bottle of water. The FA's also offer drink service along with the snack box. They apologized that due to Covid-19 they can no longer offer hot meal but only snack box in this (short) flight. Very good engagement, again, makes me realize why they were the best FAs! We left 27 minutes behind schedule due to some late passengers, but were able to arrive 12:26 PM local time, 14 minutes early from our scheduled arrival.

We had no choice but to cancel the flights because it was completely impossible to return! Then, when we cancelled and used an alternative provider, they offered us a 'Travel Credit', which a) we have no intention to use in the next 12 months as travelling is virtually impossible at this stage, and b) we want to refund because we won't be able to use it. They then, would not provide a refund at all, and all my efforts to contact them to resolve this have landed on deaf ears - they completely ignore me!

88,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew with Garuda to Bali and back. Their service in-flight is very friendly and good. Checking in at AMS was a tiny bit of a hassle, due to the fact that they let this be handled by Swissport - they just changed this, so we didn't know beforehand. Checking in at DPS however was fine. Due to COVID-19 we needed to go back to NL a week early. Garuda offered special treatment as rebooking could be done at no additional cost (!!) which is very generous from them I think (in comparison, KLM, our national carrier in NL stopped flying at all!). I chat with the Garuda team online at saturday morning about our situation, and, believe it or not, that same evening we could fly back to AMS at 19:05! How's that for service? Checking in at DPS was very friendly and helpful. They arranged the new boarding passes for us so we could get back to NL safe and sound. Arriving in AMS we unfortunately found out that our baggage didn't come with us. In these rare conditions, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of people took extra baggage with them and Garuda was forced to leave a lot of it behind. I heard from multiple other people they had the same issue, but the baggage arrives fine a few days later. At this time of writing we don't have it back, but it has been just one day, and we should get it in about 3 days - so we don't worry too much about this. All in all, flying with this Asian airline the first time, was very pleasant. Seats of the flight (777-300ER 3U3) were quite large and spacious, but we are just shorties (1.7m) so no leg problems here. As we had a free seat next to us on both flights, we had plenty of space. The in-flight services (beverages and drinks) were also fine. We had chicken, rice and some veggies and another time we had salmon, rice and veggies. In between we got some bread and other small snacks. It was so unfortunate for the stewardesses to need to wear masks, as they all looked so friendly. In-flight connectivity was superb, compared to (for example) United, the Wi-Fi speed was so fast that you could even stream movies from Netflix or Prime most of the flight! Also, the pricing for Wi-Fi was acceptable at around 20 euros for 24 hours. As a conclusion I can really recommend flying with Garuda when you're flying from AMS to DPS (or the other way around). They offer very good service, bigger seats and most important, customer comes in front of money-making. Where our national carrier KLM just stopped flying at all, Garuda keeps flying for at least another week to get passengers back home in these difficult crisis times.",2020-03-22,flew garuda bali back service inflight friendly good check am tiny bit hassle due fact let handle swissport change didnt know beforehand check dp however fine due covid19 need go back nl week early garuda offer special treatment rebooking could do additional cost generous think comparison klm national carrier nl stop fly chat garuda team online saturday morning situation believe even could fly back am 1905 hows service check dp friendly helpful arrange new boarding pass us could get back nl safe sound arrive am unfortunately found baggage didnt come us rare condition due covid19 outbreak lot people take extra baggage garuda force leave lot behind heard multiple people issue baggage arrives fine day later time write dont back one day get 3 day dont worry much fly asian airline first time pleasant seat flight 777300er 3u3 quite large spacious shorties 17m leg problem free seat next us flight plenty space inflight service beverage drink also fine chicken rice veggie another time salmon rice veggie get bread small snack unfortunate stewardess need wear mask look friendly inflight connectivity superb compare example united wifi speed fast could even stream movie netflix prime flight also pricing wifi acceptable around 20 euro 24 hour conclusion really recommend fly garuda youre fly am dp way around offer good service big seat important customer come front moneymaking national carrier klm stop fly garuda keep fly least another week get passenger back home difficult crisis time,Positive

93,"✅ Trip Verified |  Beijing to Denpasar Bali. Disappointed by Garuda Indonesia on this specific service, especially when compared to their other A330 flights from Denpasar or Jakarta to Australian destinations. The aircraft is older than most other A330 services (built in 1998) and its interior appears to have stayed the same, with no inflight entertainment screens, comparably tiny overhead baggage bins, seat pitch of around 31 inches in an all economy layout. It seems like GA operates most of its oldest aircraft in all economy configurations on flights from Indonesia to Beijing, due to the comparatively high percentage of tourists who are very sensitive to price. However, at a similar price to other both Chinese airlines and international ones offering a connection, it's definitely a hard one for GA to stand out from the crowd, even if at a comparatively lower price. However, on the good side, the fantastic cabin crew service as well as its food is still shown on this flight.",2020-02-14,beijing denpasar bali disappointed garuda indonesia specific service especially compare a330 flight denpasar jakarta australian destination aircraft old a330 service built 1998 interior appear stayed inflight entertainment screen comparably tiny overhead baggage bin seat pitch around 31 inch economy layout seem like ga operates old aircraft economy configuration flight indonesia beijing due comparatively high percentage tourist sensitive price however similar price chinese airline international one offering connection definitely hard one ga stand crowd even comparatively low price however good side fantastic cabin crew service well food still show flight,Positive

I note that Garuda use agents in Amsterdam rather than their own team. Garuda uses the KLM lounge in Amsterdam which is quit large, however it is mainly full from early morning until midday, therefore very difficult to find a seat. Therefore I went straight to the gate and waiting for boarding. We boarded on time, however the aircraft pulled back a little behind schedule, but that did not delay our arrival in Medan. Onboard the cabin crew started serving drinks as soon as we sat down and also took note of what I wanted after take off. The menu selection of food and drinks was quite good and the crew keep coming around offering snacks and drinks after main meal was served. The main meal which I chose was the COD and it tasted very good and was well presented. After arrival in Medan I was assisted through immigration and baggage collection. After clearing customs my baggage was taken by the ground staff for forwarding to the Jakarta flight. The Medan-Jakarta sector again was good as their was a selection of Asian and western food available for breakfast. Again the service onboard was very good.

99,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Denpasar via Medan. I was initially excited to be travelling with Garuda on the new A330 neo. However that excitement soon faded and the worst business class flight I have ever taken. First of all the crew weren’t ready when we boarded, no alcoholic drinks were offered pre take off. It took them 3 hours to serve lunch. The starter was a prawn and the main course of beef was as tough as an old boot. Service continued to be incredibly slow throughout the flight. The thing that got my blood boiling was when a member of crew asked whether an ill member of crew could sit next to me? I said no because I didn’t want to catch what they had. To my amazement this was ignored and when I returned from the toilet the said crew member was asleep  next to me!

For example, there was a hole between an upper panel and a wall, it vibrated during the flight. I was really surprised there was no onboard entertainment system and no USB-socket.

109,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Sydney. I used Bid Upgrade to get the business seat in this flight and perhaps that was the reason I felt ignored unlike few previous experience with Garuda when we purchased the business class tickets outright. All the ground experience was fine. On boarding the FA came around offering drinks and taking notes on what the breakfast choice to be. Then I went off sleeping until I heard sounds of plates and cutlery as sign of they were starting serving breakfast. I was not served my breakfast even though I turned my seat upright, FAs just walked pass me back and forth. At first, I thought I should just wait maybe mine will come soon - it did not until we landed. No one asked if I'd like anything to drink, I had to ring the bell to ask for a cup of coffee and it was too late to ask for breakfast then. Once we landed, the FA who took my order came to me and said I was sleeping soundly that she did not want to wake me up hence I skipped breakfast. The fact that I sat there the entire time they served breakfast and kept asking my neighbor passengers what else they'd like felt like an insult to me. Would I fly with Garuda again? Yes, if we are flying to Indonesia, but never use the Big Upgrade anymore. It's such a shame that I have always recommended them before as we have always received great hospitality prior.

127,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have heard good things about Garuda Indonesia which is why we chose them for our first return trip to Bali in October 2019. They really are an excellent airline; even the economy seats have good legroom and pitch and the IFE is adequate although there are some very outdated movies and a small selection of various TV shows. However, for a short flight such as Melbourne to Denpasar, one movie would usually suffice. Everything has been thought of, blankets, sleep masks etc and the FAs move effortlessly around the aircraft with drinks and snacks regularly and the main meals are hot and tasty; usually consisting of chicken or fish. The only criticism I would have would be is that there are several long winded flight deck announcements made in Indonesian but very brief annoucments made in English so you don't really get much information which I found a little odd, especially returning to Melbourne when the plane was 99% full of English speakers. I do respect the fact it is an Indonesian owned plane but that needs to be reviewed.

Return journey I went to check in at DPS and airport security said my Macbook Pro has a battery recall which they need to make Garuda aware of.

I told them that this was their fault and they had to find a solution to get us to Shanghai that day. Checkin then  re-opened but I was told they would not give me my Macbook back. So I was in the position of losing the computer or business class tickets. Decided to leave the computer, given no official form or statement to say that Garuda had taken it and was given no information on how to claim it back.

Legroom was decent for the short haul flight, IFE working nicely with reasonable choices of content, the provided headphones were also quite comfortable and sounded reasonably ok (unlike some cheapo earphones given away by other airlines). Despite the short flying time of 1.5h between Singapore and Jakarta, Garuda provides a full meal service, with two choices to choose from, to my delight. On the way back it even offered the choice of a special dish from Padang, which was created by one of the famous Padang Restaurants in Indonesia. This was quite the highlight. The not-so-good: Windows were dusty somehow (but rest of the cabin were actually quite reasonably clean).

Welcomed by the cabin crew with a warm smile and greetings, Candy and Newspaper were provided. So, unfortunately I sat in the middle because apparently the window seats are all full. The seats were comfortable and also you have extra legroom. They have inflight entertainment system and its decently nice although the screen isn't really responsive (you need to press a bit harder/ it might take time to load). There are good selection of movies and tv shows and also many more. I ended up watching some movies however, i noticed that i didn't have a headphone so i ask the flight attendants to bring me one. Snacks (ts only a 40 minute flight) they serve was quiet nice as well which consist of bun, cake, and brownie and also a towel) There's also many choices for the drink.

The On board service was ok, however there was only two selections of food being served and none of these were western. I find this hard to comprehend as over 85% of the business class passengers on the flight were westerners.

The seat was not anything special but comfortable (similar to that on Asiana and Vietnam Airlines A350). Cabin crew was attentive and genuinely nice. However, the highlight was the food. Meal presentations were meticulous in the way of first class service elsewhere, and the food tasted equally good. Dishes were served not on a tray, but separately plated; each was accompanied by new utensils to match, and that created a proper restaurant feel. In my opinion, food is the least important thing on a flight, but it is the same time the most recognizable measure of an airline's service quality.

The lounge itself was also very quiet due to the late evening. The gate for boarding the flight is a good 15 minute walk from the lounge, however not too bad as there was little people around.

214,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Jakarta, the service was great, the flight was on schedule, and the aircraft was clean. However, the frequent flyer program (GarudaMiles) is one of the worst frequent flyer program that I ever encountered.

230,"✅ Trip Verified | I have taken several business flights with Garuda (two long haul - one in an A330 and one in a B777). The B777 business seat is the cocoon type. However, when flattened, the seat is too short to sleep flat out (I'm 1m90 / 6ft3), and it is too narrow to comfortably curl up. The seat cushion also has bumps and ridges across its surface (where the seat surfaces intersect). Other airlines provide top matresses to cover up this up (e.g. ANA, NZA). It's the least comfortable business class seat I have had so far. Luggage is not automatically forwarded to connecting flights (my case in AMS). As a consequence, in such cases the airline will sell you tickets with unusually long stopovers. - It was not possible to reserve a specific seat on some flights. You might get assigned the worst possible seat at check-in. Amenities were standard. No socks or pijama top, so you sleep in your clothes. On the plus side: food and drinks were excellent, staff was very helpful and friendly. Also, the seat had a handy foldaway table which could swivel to allow you to get in or our your seat, without having to clear the table. That's very handy when dining or working - other airlines should take not. I will review the A330 flight separately, as it had a different business class cabin.",2018-10-24,take several business flight garuda two long haul one a330 one b777 b777 business seat cocoon type however flatten seat short sleep flat im 1m90 6ft3 narrow comfortably curl seat cushion also bump ridge across surface seat surface intersect airline provide top matresses cover eg ana nza least comfortable business class seat far luggage automatically forward connect flight case am consequence case airline sell ticket unusually long stopover possible reserve specific seat flight might get assign bad possible seat checkin amenity standard sock pijama top sleep clothes plus side food drink excellent staff helpful friendly also seat handy foldaway table could swivel allow get seat without clear table thats handy din work airline take review a330 flight separately different business class cabin,Positive

233,"✅ Trip Verified | The boarding was chaotic, as apparently due to cost saving, GA used one gate for 3 flights departing around the same time, unbelievably a brainless decision! I think it was not only confusing but dangerous (if one goes to the wrong direction, can one end up in another country as all three are international flights). A lot of ground staff around the gate but very inefficient, they did not seem know what to do, so yelled at each other in loud voices. Then we still had to walk a long way through a stuffy corridor to get to the aircraft (parked in domestic area). It was such an irony as I saw Narita-bound LCC Air Asia used the gate next door alone so that passengers did not have to walk far and no chaos. Boarded, was shocked by the new Diamond seat that looked and felt cheap (same design as in their B777 Business but of low-cost material), the design was poor, there was a huge gap between the aircraft window to the seat that anything could easily fall through, and one would have to bother the passenger behind to retrieve. Amenity was worse, of very cheap quality. The food and entertainment menu has not changed in forever, a frequent traveller easily gets bored!

I would like to see Garuda taking lost property more seriously.  Two of us used Garuda's contact-us page to follow up on some lost property in the cabin. One week later there has been no response despite our email address details being left on the form. Phone calls with Garuda's Denpasar office were difficult and unhelpful regarding lost property. We were passed to multiple people before being brushed off. Currently, Garuda's written policy is to take zero responsibility for cabin items, which in our experience, seems to have rippled through to a lack of regard from staff and process.  In an environment where significant fares are paid, passengers are known and seats are numbered, better efforts should be made to track items if they are left behind. It's great to have a diligent cabin crew who made sure we were well fed on the flight. However, we’ve been frustrated by the experience, tracking our lost iPad to a location in West Java with no support from Garuda.",2018-10-15,melbourne denpasar receive good service whilst plane plane another matter would like see garuda take lose property seriously two us use garuda contactus page follow lose property cabin one week later response despite email address detail left form phone call garuda denpasar office difficult unhelpful regard lose property pass multiple people brush currently garuda write policy take zero responsibility cabin item experience seem ripple lack regard staff process environment significant fare paid passenger know seat numbered well effort make track item left behind great diligent cabin crew make sure well fed flight however weve frustrate experience track lose ipad location west java support garuda,Positive
235,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Jakarta. I had the pleasure of flying Garuda First Class before they discontinue the London route and it was an absolute joy. The cabin crew were so kind and friendly and the food and comfort on the flight second to none. Upon arrival at Jakarta all first class passengers were escorted through immigration and were seated in a waiting lounge while their bags were collected and delivered to them. Such a great service which I cannot recommend highly enough. Returning from Jakarta to London in Business Class was vastly different to the first class experience and not as good as I have previously experienced. There is evidence of cost cutting both in the amenity kit and also the food used noticeably cheaper ingredients. The service from the cabin crew was lacking compared to my previous trips. On the evidence of this, I doubt if I will bother to use Garuda long haul again as it involves going via Amsterdam and there are plenty of other good choices out there.

240,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to London. Just returned from my much awaited trip with Garuda in Business class, I was seated at 6A. The lounge in Jakarta is perfectly ok,  not like the Middle East carriers and no apparent alcoholic drinks on display but when requested they appear from somewhere. Additionally no diet drinks in fridge but they appear from somewhere when requested. I find this all a bit strange and certainly doesn’t provide any visual improvement to services provided. It does though (in my opinion) present some clear evidence of what’s doing on in the minds of Garuda’s team - not trying too hard are they? Boarding was usual chaotic mess which again is very easily managed if they try hard enough. As someone who usually flies Qatar or Oman Air, the moment I stepped onboard I could see an immediate difference for the worse. They aren’t engaged with you.  Seat was fine, but movie selection old and limited. The biggest issue is service - there isn’t any. Not unless it’s the regular points where they come to ask which meals you want. During the 14 hr flight the NEVER came to ask if I wanted anything or if I’d like a drink topped up. I pressed the call button and that made no difference either. I sat with an empty glass for 45mins. I eventually went up and asked directly.  They were very reluctant to make eye contact of speak to the customers around me. Finally the onboard purser was worse than useless. He in my opinion may be at the root of the problem. Not one did he speak to anyone on business despite pacing around between 1st and business. Over the last few weeks I’ve sent several messaged through their support forms and you guessed it - no reply at all. Even follow up messages to investigate why I’ve had no reply.

This delay caused us to make a dash to the connecting LHR flight in JAK.

The A330 (MEL-JAK) had a 2-2-2 layout in an older style cabin, but it was comfortable. The B777-300 (JAK-LHR) had a 1-2-1 layout. It was a more modern cabin.

What the airline has going for them are  the very friendly and helpful flight attendants,  reasonably comfortable seats for the 1.5 hour flight,  good benefits for their Gold and Platinum tier frequent fliers (lounge access, priority boarding, priority check-in counter, additional check-in luggage). What they need to improve on are the in flight meals (repetitive and no change for long periods of time),  repetitive on board announcements (starts with the flight service manager going through exactly what is found in their safety briefing video) and  the lack of bin space for carry on luggage (this one is the result of an overly lenient policy on passengers allowing oversize and multiple bags).

A glass of champagne and a hot towel while settling in, really good service through the trip, and the very welcome flat bed on the A330. The difference between business class on the A330, and 737 of other operators is stark. Meals were very good, wine choices excellent, entertainment a little limited when compared to other carriers but ok. Overall experience worth the extra cost of biz-class... including being able to leave aircraft and get to immigration first. No luggage? You're out the door quickly and heading for your transport.

273,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Sydney via Jakarta. While the quality of the service in the air is good, on the ground it is bad. They outsource their ground staff at Heathrow to DNata, who couldn't care less. My wife was one kilo over in business class and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude. They advertise business promo fares on their website as being refundable and changeable. If you attempt to change a flight, however, they advised me that the ticket is not changeable. No local office where you bought the ticket will help you, they will refer you to the Indonesian headquarters, which are full of  staff reading off scripts and there is no escalation process to speak to anyone who can help. Our schedule changed four times from booking to takeoff, and their staff accidentally cancelled my frequent flyer account and refused to add back miles from my flights. The lounge in Jakarta has very little air conditioning so you sweat the whole time you're in transit, the food is bad, there was no alcohol and the seating is uncomfortable. The shower was too busy to use so you queue up, and they ran out of towels and gave me two face towels to dry myself.",2018-04-27,london sydney via jakarta quality service air good ground bad outsource ground staff heathrow dnata couldnt care less wife one kilo business class woman behind counter incredibly rude advertise business promo fare website refundable changeable attempt change flight however advise ticket changeable local office bought ticket help refer indonesian headquarters full staff reading script escalation process speak anyone help schedule change four time book takeoff staff accidentally cancel frequent flyer account refuse add back mile flight lounge jakarta little air conditioning sweat whole time youre transit food bad alcohol seat uncomfortable shower busy use queue ran towel give two face towel dry,Negative

275,"✅ Trip Verified | There were no real problems with this flight, however it amazes me that the male pursers seem not to be very engaged. I think the only words he said to me during the flight were welcome onboard, when I boarded the aircraft. The purser should set the standard. He (she) should come to each pax at the commencement of the flight and welcome them on board and/or thank each pax at the end of the flight. This particular flight was not full in business class and yet not once did a flight attendant mention me by name. The minimum would be use each pax name when they are taking meal orders. At one stage I was asked if I would like still or sparkling water, when I asked for soda water, I was informed that Garuda did not stock soda water so sparkling water was ok. Then I ordered some Chablis, again later in the flight when I asked for another glass of chablis, I was told that that there was none left. Again, not the end of the world, however as I mentioned earlier, the flight was not full in business class and there were quite a few children (who don't drink alcohol), so the amount uploaded seems to be insufficient. When dessert was served (it was supposed to be served with ice cream) I asked where the ice cream was and was informed that it wasn't uploaded. So a cold dry cake was not very palatable. As food the food itself. It wasn't horrible, but was not great. An amuse bouche with mashed tuna in a half piece of choux. Then minced salmon with over-cooked scallops, followed.

The flat beds were adequately comfortable (so much better that the awful ironing board beds on Virgin Atlantic 787 aircraft - the worst Business Class ever). Flight attendants were excellent, the food of good quality and beautifully presented. We have flown to Australia with many different airlines over the years and Garuda is amongst the best.

298,"✅ Trip Verified |  While the overall trip was amazing, many aspects fell short. Upon checking in, I learned that 5 out of 8 passengers in First class had upgraded. As a full fare F passenger, I was disappointed because not only I ended up paying a lot more, but also I'd be in a packed cabin translating to less personal attention by the crew. The difference was full fare F passengers were personally escorted to the lounge and onto the plane. The lounge at LHR was very crowded. I had a reserved table waiting for me at the lounge and I was able to use the shower for free. However, champagne was not complimentary and I had to pay GBP6 per flute if I order one. Boarding was fantastic as I boarded before it began and I was offered champagne right away by the fantastic crew. They had 2 types of champagne on offer and I ended up trying both during boarding. I saw my neighbour had red and white wine - so I assume you can pretty much order whatever drinks you'd like. It was obvious the crew were slightly overwhelmed as 1 crew kept on addressed me by the wrong name on 2 occasions. She was apologetic and I had no problem with it. I received a kit with very mediocre content (worse than the kit I got when traveling GA J a year before).  However, upon landing, I was given the proper F kit by the ground staff and I was informed they ran out while in London. This might sound trivial, but I ended up noticing things like these when I was flying First. The service was nothing short of spectacular, crew went above and beyond from preparing a wine tasting session (GA had 6 different wine) to sharing holiday stories. Meals were also good. I found the seat to be very comfortable for lounging and sleeping (a duvet was provided for turn down service). IFE could use more selection on movies and complete seasons of TV shows. Arrival service was another major let down for me. Despite receiving a confirmation prior to the trip that I could use their J lounge for a shower after landing in Jakarta (they could not grant me access to their F lounge which was odd considering they granted passengers access when they have a connecting flight even on non-GA flight), I was disappointed to learn upon landing that I could only use the arrival lounge. It was barely a lounge, it was more of a room with small seating areas for F/J pax to wait for their luggages plus 1 shower stall. They did not have a towel in the shower room and nothing could be done by the clueless staff manning the lounge. Overall, GA's F was a very solid product, but I would not pay full fare to fly on it.",2018-01-04,overall trip amaze many aspect fell short upon check learn 5 8 passenger first class upgraded full fare f passenger disappointed end pay lot also id packed cabin translate less personal attention crew difference full fare f passenger personally escort lounge onto plane lounge lhr crowd reserve table wait lounge able use shower free however champagne complimentary pay gbp6 per flute order one boarding fantastic board begin offer champagne right away fantastic crew 2 type champagne offer end try boarding saw neighbour red white wine assume pretty much order whatever drink youd like obvious crew slightly overwhelmed 1 crew kept address wrong name 2 occasion apologetic problem receive kit mediocre content bad kit get travel ga j year however upon land give proper f kit ground staff inform ran london might sound trivial end notice thing like fly first service nothing short spectacular crew go beyond prepare wine taste session ga 6 different wine share holiday story meal also good found seat comfortable lounge sleep duvet provide turn service ife could use selection movie complete season tv show arrival service another major let despite receive confirmation prior trip could use j lounge shower land jakarta could grant access f lounge odd consider grant passenger access connect flight even nonga flight disappointed learn upon land could use arrival lounge barely lounge room small seat area fj pax wait luggage plus 1 shower stall towel shower room nothing could do clueless staff man lounge overall gas f solid product would pay full fare fly,Positive

300,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Hong Kong return. The cabin crew did an exceptional job  and upon my return, the Maitre du Cabin greeted every passenger on business class to thank them for choosing Garuda Indonesia. The food selection were of three main courses and mostly were of Asian influence. Both presentation and quality were superior and I wish they collaborate permanently with renown chefs as their panels. Quality of amenity and toiletry kits have been upgraded to Clarins which feel more luxurious. If there's downside of the flights would be the choices of beverages which were  limited. Choices of alcoholic beverages look somewhat dull and dry compared to other airlines and they still don't provide signature cocktail and mocktail until now which is a pity. All in all, I'd recommend to take business class of Garuda Indonesia, as they gave me nice and comfortable service during my flights.",2018-01-03,jakarta hong kong return cabin crew exceptional job upon return maitre du cabin greet every passenger business class thank choose garuda indonesia food selection three main course mostly asian influence presentation quality superior wish collaborate permanently renown chef panel quality amenity toiletry kit upgraded clarins feel luxurious there downside flight would choice beverage limited choice alcoholic beverage look somewhat dull dry compare airline still dont provide signature cocktail mocktail pity id recommend take business class garuda indonesia give nice comfortable service flight,Positive

336,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Jakarta to Palembang on GA112 on the 22nd of September. Our plane was a well-maintained, Sky Interior 737. Seat comfort was top notch, with generous padding and comfortable headrests. Seat width was inadequate, although to be expected from a 737, while pitch was well above industry average. Crew were again nothing short of exceptional, and almost every one of my flights with them met or even exceeded my already high expectations for GA’s service delivery. IFE was perfectly fine, even for a medium haul international flight.

Prior to take-off the male FA closed the overhead compartment leaving part of amenity plastic bag dangling, despite a few rounds of take-off preparation checking by FAs, nobody noticed it that I had to warn him as it may increase the chance the compartment will open during take-off. From his response, I'd say he did not seem to understand the importance of the issue in view of safety. He also lacked basic skills in service, when serving food it seemed like he was doing it for the first time and was very clumsy, eg: giving me a cup of tea with sugar but no stirrer.",2017-09-06,review flew haneda tokyo jakarta often fly garuda notice lack consistency service quality flight id say experienced one bad prior takeoff male fa close overhead compartment leave part amenity plastic bag dangle despite round takeoff preparation check fa nobody notice warn may increase chance compartment open takeoff response id say seem understand importance issue view safety also lack basic skill service serve food seem like first time clumsy eg give cup tea sugar stirrer,Positive

359,"✅ Verified Review |  Beijing to Jakarta via Bali. Since our flight was going to depart at 6:45am, we had to depart from our hotel at around 4, arriving 45 minutes later by which point the check-in counters (there were six of them) were crowded. The flight was delayed by 5 hours, due to a perfect storm of a 2h late departure from Bali, bad weather at PEK, and unprecedented heavy congestion at PEK as well.  This delay would also eventually cause most of the passengers bound for Jakarta to miss their connecting flights. However,  Garuda rebooked every Jakarta-bound passenger on GA421 for free. Both legs were operated by a 2-class high-density 777. Economy seat comfort was top-notch, pitch was acceptable at 32 inches, and Garuda has 18.5"" wide seats in a 9-abreast configuration. Recline was large - 6 inches. IFE screens were 9"" wide and had swipe and scroll capabilities although they were still running on the older eX2 platform with the older monitors, and while the contents were hardly updated since June, they had 8 Live TV channels. Food, on the PEK-DPS leg, had a main course that tasted much better than the one I had on the previous CGK-PEK leg, but at the expense of portion (it was tiny.) The chocolate cake dessert tasted incredible. We were also treated to a bag of mixed nuts as well as sumptuous ice cream just before arrival in Bali. This streak of great tasting food continued on the DPS-CGK leg, with it tying for the best main course meal onboard Garuda I ever had. Service on the PEK-DPS leg was above the impeccable service on my previous CGK-PEK leg, with crew in very cheerful and bright spirits.

IFE was on an intuitive 11.1"" touchscreen - not quite the best, but still decent - with content that is hardly updated: it remained the exact same throughout the months of June and July. Food decent as well - nothing to write home about - albeit with noticeably smaller main course portions. However, the crew stood out on this flight - they were quick, attentive, professional, generous and friendly, providing genuine service. One thing to note: terrible 3am timing of arrival in Beijing caused most passengers to not get enough sleep. Also on this flight was a turbulence that rocked the plane for the majority of the flight - this further reduced my duration of sleep.

Terrific champagne which always makes me happy. Price - cheapest business class to Europe at the time of booking. On time - no delays. Cons: Jakarta stop over - it's long and the airport is dismal, likewise the lounge. I dont know if there's a refurb happening in the future but it needs it. IFE - not great selection. I had exhausted all options by the time we got to Jakarta. Ensured I slept more on flight through to AMS. In summary, given the price paid it was a very pleasant journey.

369,"✅ Verified Review |  Jakarta to Surabaya. This is my first time using T3 at Jakarta Airport. The airport is impressive compared to the old one but there is a design flaw which is letting too much light so at day time it is very hot inside.

After check in and passing the security, I visited the lounge which had a great selection of food and drink and a relaxing foot massage. I used Sky Priority for boarding so I didn't have to queue. Onboard, the flight attendant offered me a welcome drink and a hot towel. Then after the plane took off, the FA served the inflight meal which was Opor Ayam (Chicken with Indonesian Curry seasoning) followed by selection of fruits and drinks (orange / apple juice, tea, coffee or milk).

376,"✅ Verified Review |  Went on CGK-SUB and BWX-CGK via SUB last December with Garuda Indonesia. The first leg was on a standard 737. Seat pitch was mediocre at best, seat comfort unremarkable. IFE was of the newer, more responsive interface. Unfortunately, plane was hot, and we were served snacks for the 80 minute sector. However, the snacks were tasty. The second flight was on an ATR72 from BWX to SUB on GA7305. This sector was delayed by an hour, but compensation was more than enough - two discount vouchers. Although this was a short 30-minute hop, the legroom, snacks and crew were all great. Flight was perfectly smooth although we passed through thick clouds. Finally was GA323, SUB-CGK onboard an ancient 747. We were seated on the upper deck, and this gave a sense of tranquility and peace as there were very few other people.  Despite the age, the 747 was amazingly comfortable, with cold cabins and calming ambient lighting. Seat pitch was well above average. Crew were very professional, courteous and friendly. This was a great throwback to the 1990's and did not disappoint at all, despite the lack of a proper IFE. One of the best flights of my life thus far, despite the turbulence. Too bad the 747s have been retired now. Overall it was a really enjoyable experience on Garuda, except for the rather mediocre first sector of the trip.

We go to the International check-in counter where they prepared everything (luggage, boarding pass, etc). After check in we proceed to the immigration. However, I was kinda dissapointed as there was no fast lane and I stood for 15 minutes (I think Garuda should've provided a premium fast lane for their first class passenger to avoid any airport hustle). The lounge is not as impressive as they have in CGK, it's a small but functional lounge with a few sets of table for a la carte dinner and relaxing chair. Nothing much too review, but with excellent service from lounge staff.  When it was already time to board my assistant then came to me and escorted me to the boarding gate. Excellent service from the first class ground staff in DPS. Crew warmly welcomed me by giving their signature Salam Garuda. One of crew escorted me to my seat 1A and poured a Billecart Rose along with nuts and Oshibori. The purser prepared the caviar served with blinish, sour cream and prawn cracker (Indonesian style as the crew called it). It was delicious.. 30mins later the chef on board approached me and discussed about my menu for breakfast.  After finished my meal, I asked the crew to prepare my bed that comes with a duvet and it was so comfy. As I woke up 4.5 hrs later, the crew served an orange juice before they prepared my Japanese Kaiseki Meal (the presentation was excellent). The chef then came to me to ask for my opinion and I think that's a good thing as they tried to interact and get a feedback from the passenger.  The plane then start to descend when the breakfast service finished, and 1 hour later we landed smoothly at NRT airport.

403,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew Garuda Indonesia, economy class, to and from Melbourne from UK in Jan/Feb 2017. We were impressed with all aspects of the in-flight experience. We were provided with all the necessary extras for a comfortable long haul flight (blankets, pillow, socks etc), the in-flight entertainment was good, the food and beverages were varied and the service from the cabin crew staff was superb. We had two short transfers on the way out and Garuda staff helped us negotiate our way around strange airports. The one hitch we had was that our luggage did not make it onto the last plane (due to late arrival shortening the transfer slot) but this was sorted out efficiently on arrival. We were looking for a cheaper flight and felt we got really good value for money from Garuda.

416,"✅ Verified Review |  CGK-PKU, GA 170 using B738 registration PK-GME. Haven't used Garuda for almost a decade, heard that they made great progress, was looking forward to prove it and was not disappointed. Checked-in online and drop off bag at new Terminal 3 Cengkareng-Jakarta. At this moment Terminal 3 was exclusively used for Garuda domestic flights, it was huge and airy, with nice features and lots of open space but can do with more informative signage such as required time to get to a certain gate by foot. The aircraft was parked away on a stand and we have to be bused from the terminal building. It was very inconvenient, considering there were so many gates/airbridges we saw that were vacant, and also the fact that the bus trip creating delay for the flight since last busload of passengers had to wait for passing aircrafts before it was able to cross the tarmac! The flight left almost an hour late because of this boarding process and arrived 30 minutes later than scheduled. However the service throughout the flight made up to the issue. We were greeted warmly when we enter the plane by FAs, candies were distributed while waiting for the remaining passengers, and there was announcement from the flight deck about the reasons why the flight was delayed. Flight deck also informed on the expected arrival time and weather conditions in Pekanbaru before we start the descent. The seats have large seat pitch and tons of legroom, perhaps up to 32-33 inches between seats. There is seatback personal touchscreen entertainment system with adequate selection of movies, music and TV series, enough to keep entertained for short flights up to 3-4 hours. For this short flight (1 hour 10 minutes) there was full service hot breakfast and drinks. The FAs were really polite, courteous and helpful, and they give great service with a smile. They were very personable. When I got on board, I asked if they have a certain type of merchandise (an airplane model). They told me they would look for it, and they promptly helped me with the purchase right after breakfast service without being asked twice.

Garuda are the only carrier to offer a non-stop service on this route and the scheduled journey time is 13 hours and 50 minutes - the longest non-stop flight I've done. The cabin was very pleasant, with a warm and homely feel to it. The crew were very welcoming and pre-departure drinks were offered. Shortly after take-off, the crew took orders for dinner and the food was excellent - the best airline meal that I have had. As other reviews have noted, all business class seats have direct access to the aisle, which is fantastic. The seats were very comfortable and the blanket was almost like a duvet - very impressive. This ensured a comfortable sleep. The cabin crew remained friendly throughout the long flight and nothing was too much trouble for them. It was a real pleasure to travel on this airline and I would definitely opt for Garuda when travelling this route in the future. The only anomaly is that Garuda don't offer a non-stop service from Jakarta to London. Flights touch down in Singapore for a fuelling stop or there is the option to transit in Amsterdam. Hopefully this will be addressed in the future. Overall, this was an excellent flying experience at a competitive price.

Following a 3 hour ""layover"" at Jakarta, I was ready the continue my onward flight to Singapore. Business class on the 737 was a 2-2 configuration and I had the front 2 seats to myself with another passenger occupying the other 2 front row seats across the gangway. Otherwise, business class was empty but economy appeared to be full. These are not lie flat seats but given the relative shortness of the flight, (1hour 30 minutes) offer more than adequate space and comfort. I was greeted warmly by the steward who addressed me by my name and offered a warm towel and champagne prior to departure. I was asked for my choice of post take off drink and my choice for dinner which consisted of a mixed salad with dressing, and then a choice from 3 main courses, followed by desert. In addition to the Champagne, there was a choice of 2 white and 2 red wines to accompany the meal. All 3 courses of the dinner were served together which, given the relative shortness of the flight, was not unreasonable, and my choice of Fillet Mignon with accompanying vegetables was excellent. The crew were very attentive and provided an excellent level of service throughout the flight. I was asked by the steward if I objected to an economy class passengers cabin bag being placed in a business class over head bin because the economy class bins were all full. On arrival at Singapore, disembarkation at Changi was swift but business class passengers are not offered a fast track pass through immigration, although this did not prove to be a problem as there were few arriving passengers. The only negative about this service is that despite being labelled clearly as business class priority luggage, my bag arrived on the carousel last! Not sure if this is something to do with the bags being transferred from the London flight, but I did spend a few anxious minutes waiting and wondering if it hadn't been loaded onto the flight.

434,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Jakarta. Priority check in was excellent as was the fast track pass through security. Garuda do not have their own dedicated lounge at LHR and I was directed to the Number 1 traveller lounge which was a disappointment. Very busy, it was impossible to obtain a table in the dining area and I managed to eventually find an empty seat in the lounge area. Leaving this to go to the bar to obtain a drink, my seat had been taken when I returned! Once on board the aircraft, the service was superb. Pre boarded and greeted by my name, I was shown to my seat (6K) and offered Champage and hot towel. My order was taken for post take off drinks and the In flight meal. After take off the drink was served promptly and courteously and I was again addressed by my name. Dinner consisted of a choice of 4 appetizers,4 main courses, cheese and biscuits and a choice of 2 desserts and each course was served separately. A selection of Champagne, 3 white wines, 3 red wines and a desert wine complimented the meal, although this aspect of the service was a little slower and the crew seemed suprised that I wanted white wine with the appetizer and then change to red wine with the main course. The seat was particularly comfortable and had direct aisle access (1-2-1 configuration) despite being a window seat. Following a good night's sleep, I enjoyed a pleasant breakfast of fresh fruit, yogurt and cereals followed by a choice from 3 dishes on the main course.

435,"Flew Singapore to London Heathrow with Garuda. Business class check in was fast and efficient and I was provided with an invitation to the Dnata lounge which was quiet and relaxing prior to the long flight back to London. Boarding was on time and business class passengers were offered priority boarding. There are 2 business class cabins on Garuda's 777 and I chose seat 6K (the same as on my outbound flight), immediately behind the 1st class cabin, that appeared to be empty. I'm not sure how many business class passengers were in the 2nd business cabin, but I had the entire front cabin to myself. The customary glass of champage and hot towel were provided prior to take off along wth my order for a post take off drink and my selection for lunch. This consisted of a choice from 4 appetizers, 4 main courses, cheese and a choice of 2 deserts. The identical wine selection of Champagne, 3 white wines, 3 red wines and a desert wine were offered as on the outbound flight. Garuda also place significant importance on the selection of teas and coffees that they offer with no fewer than 6 different teas and 2 coffees, that can be served 8 different ways. The whole food and beverage service was excellent in terms of quality, presentation and service. Despite this being a flight operating throughout daylight hours and arriving into Heathrow in the early evening, I personally prefer to try and stay awake as much as possible to re accustom myself to English time, but I've noticed that all airlines that I've used on Westbound daylight flights insist on lowering the window shades and plunging the cabin into darkness after the meal and Garuda are no different. Surely it's better to let the natural daylight in and use the provided eye shades if you want to snooze. Having the cabin to myself resulted in me lifting the window blinds and bringing natural daylight back into the cabin. I doubt that this would have been tollerated if there had been other passengers in the vicinity. I.F.E. with Garuda is okay but there seems to be an accent towards Far Eastern films and my perception of Western offerings seemed somewhat dated. Prior to landing at Heathrow another meal consisting of a choice of 3 appetizers, 3 main courses and 1 desert were offered, that Garuda describe as ""refreshment,"" but was in fact a full early evening meal. An on demand cafe service of nuts, chocolate bars, soup etc. is also provided throughout the flight. Disembarkation at Heathrow was swift and efficient and a fast pass was provided for immigration although Heathrow would do well to have more staff on duty (only 2 when I arrived) as I'm not convinced that there is any significant advantage to this service. Luggage reclaim was fast with my bag first on the carousel. The actual process from disembarking to picking up my car in terminal 3's car park took 25 minutes which was pretty impressive. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable flight. Unlike some better known, perhaps more fashionable Middle Eastern airlines, Garuda offer the advantage of all business class seats on their 777's having gangway access, so you don't have to be a gymnast trying to climb over someone with their seat fully reclined if you're in a window seat, and wish to move about the cabin. This in itself is a definate advantage flying with this airline. Service is attentive and personable without being obtrusive and the food was very well presented and of a good quality. I was at first reluctant to fly with this airline but I will willingly fly with them again.",2016-10-10,flew singapore london heathrow garuda business class check fast efficient provide invitation dnata lounge quiet relax prior long flight back london boarding time business class passenger offer priority boarding 2 business class cabin garuda 777 chose seat 6k outbound flight immediately behind 1st class cabin appear empty im sure many business class passenger 2nd business cabin entire front cabin customary glass champage hot towel provide prior take along wth order post take drink selection lunch consist choice 4 appetizer 4 main course cheese choice 2 desert identical wine selection champagne 3 white wine 3 red wine desert wine offer outbound flight garuda also place significant importance selection tea coffee offer few 6 different tea 2 coffee serve 8 different way whole food beverage service excellent term quality presentation service despite flight operating throughout daylight hour arrive heathrow early even personally prefer try stay awake much possible accustom english time ive notice airline ive use westbound daylight flight insist lower window shade plunge cabin darkness meal garuda different surely well let natural daylight use provide eye shade want snooze cabin result lift window blind bring natural daylight back cabin doubt would tollerated passenger vicinity ife garuda okay seem accent towards far eastern film perception western offering seem somewhat date prior land heathrow another meal consist choice 3 appetizer 3 main course 1 desert offer garuda describe refreshment fact full early even meal demand cafe service nut chocolate bar soup etc also provide throughout flight disembarkation heathrow swift efficient fast pas provide immigration although heathrow would well staff duty 2 arrive im convince significant advantage service luggage reclaim fast bag first carousel actual process disembark pick car terminal 3s car park take 25 minute pretty impressive overall thoroughly enjoyable flight unlike well know perhaps fashionable middle eastern airline garuda offer advantage business class seat 777s gangway access dont gymnast try climb someone seat fully recline youre window seat wish move cabin definate advantage fly airline service attentive personable without obtrusive food well present good quality first reluctant fly airline willingly fly,Positive
436,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Amsterdam to Jakarta via Denpasar. Checked in from a connecting flight, first time using a Skyteam alliance airline as apposed to my normal alliance preference. Ticket was at a reasonable cost so went for Garuda for a change, bags already transferred from a connecting KLM flight. Used the KLM Crowne lounge (52) which is okay nothing special. Boarding through F12 quick and organised on to a 777-300ER which looked and felt pretty new, seat 8A in the front section of business class. Seat was comfortable in a 1-2-1 configuration so private and similar to many Asian airlines, crew provided hot towels & drinks pre-departure. Departed right on time and once airborne the service was good and attentive, meals were okay with dinner a snack mid flight and a full breakfast service 2 hours out of Jakata; I found the crew to be very polite the aircraft was kept clean during the 13hrs 30 min flight, arrived 10 minutes early, if I had a complaint the cabin temperature was far too warm for me 25c at times. Jakata (CGK) isn't the best transfer from international to domestic was pretty slow no premium service although the domestic terminal and Garuda lounge are new and pretty comfortable. Boarding on to a 737-800 from gate 12 to seat 1A the aircraft looked clean and tidy, service was really very good as was the food on this flight, departed 20 minutes late for a flight of 1hr 40 minutes, arrived just about on time on to an airbridge.

438,"✅ Verified Review |  Garuda’s Hard Product is pretty good by Economy Class standards. Heathrow – Singapore via Jakarta. Flight ex-Heathrow was a 777-300ER. Online Check In allowed me to select my seat but not to print my boarding pass. Baggage Allowance was a very generous 30kg. On time departure, aircraft appeared to be about 70% full. The seats were reasonably comfortable and leg room was good by economy class standards. Seating configuration was 3-3-3 which is better than offered by many other 777 operators. On demand entertainment system with a reasonable selection of films and music (a good proportion aimed at Asian tastes). The movies weren’t generally as current as some other long haul airlines and the menu system could have organised both movies and music more effectively for ease of navigation but there were enough of both to keep me occupied. Two hot meals served – Dinner and Breakfast – each with two options, Western and Asian. The meals were nothing at all special, standard economy class fodder really, although a printed menu was provided which was a nice touch and there were a couple of hot snack runs between the main meals. Crew were polite and reasonably visible throughout, although some of the cabin announcements were in such heavily accented English that it wasn’t always easy to understand. Connecting flight from Jakarta on a 737-800. Flight time was just 1 hour 20 minutes but impressively there was still a hot meal and full drinks service. Less impressively, I asked a stewardess whether there were any embarkation cards for Singapore but she just looked baffled and said she would be back in a moment. She never returned. Return direct Singapore - London again on a 777-300ER and again with only partly functional online check in. Departure was on time and seating configuration, occupancy, IFE pretty much the same as the outward leg. Once again, two hot meals en-route, although the only option for second meal was fish. The “hot snack” served between meals turned out to be a cold filled roll, and when I asked for a refill of coffee the stewardess seemed genuinely surprised and I was given just a quarter of a cup which turned out to be lukewarm.

442,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Denpasar via Jakarta. Garuda Indonesia offer a generous 30kg allowance in Economy class and check in online was a breeze. Slightly disappointed by the wait to drop off bags and the staff where not forthcoming with calling people across but this is not down to the airline but their handling agents at Heathrow. Onboard (boarding starting a good 60 mins before departure) we were welcomed warmly by the Purser and Senior Crew. Luckily it wasn't full I'd guess at best a 75% load in Economy (Business was half full and First Class empty) we had three seats to ourselves. Once in the air the IFE kicked in, while not as slick as EK or QR it had an ample selection for the next 15 hours. The crew offered dinner, either a western choice or Indonesian which unfortunately had run out by the time it got to us, the dinner was a bit meh but filled a gap none the less. On collecting trays a second drinks run was offered but the crew where somewhat shocked when I asked for a G&T (why offer Gin in Economy if you have to get the atomic from Business Class) lights out for the next 6 or so hours. Just off the coast of Eastern India Breakfast was offered, this time the Indonesian option was available and it was really good! The lights where dimmed again for the last few hours, however the crew passed around a warm wrap 45 mins before landing which was a nice touch. 35mins late into CGK and a long drive to T2 to clear customs and immigration then back on a bus to T3 to clear Security and go through the Boarding Gate to DPS (I think 90% of the passengers were connecting to the same quick connection flight). Leg room on the connecting A330-300 was just as good as the Boeing 777, however we departed 45mins late to wait for everyone on the late LHR flight. Again a warm meal was on offer from CGK, the main was very good, the desert was not to my liking or many others around. Landed on time into DPS, and our bags were on the belt first and into Taxi 15mins after landing!

I repeated this process many times until it finally allowed me to check in just 24 hours before the flight. The only two seats left with them were 38J and 38K. I contacted Garuda customer services by phone, and they said ""Theres nothing we can do"" or ""maybe you did something wrong"". They suggested that I get to the airport early, and at the check in desk, ask for a seat reassignment. I arrived at Terminal 3 Heathrow early, only to be met with chaos and mayhem. After a long wait, I was told that there are no other seats to be moved to. We checked our suitcases in and was told to carry our own suitcases back out the door to a cordoned off area where they were holding the luggage. Everything was fine until literally 5 minutes from boarding the plane when an announcement was made that no suitcases will be on the flight except Business and First class. I spoke to the Garuda lady and told her that my wedding was in 2 days time and she understood my situation and wold make my cases a priority. Next ensued a 13+ hour flight with no sleep because of the awful seats. When we got to Jakarta, we completed a Missing Baggage Claim form, and yet again I told them ""Wedding in 2 days, please mark very urgent"". They did mark as urgent, but this made no difference.

466,"Flew from Jakarta to Bangkok in late-June for the WSC competition, and back on the first of July. On the outbound sector, the 737 was older and seats were comfortable-. Meals were satisfying but of limited portion and adequate presentation, complete with a rujak appetizer that they have advertised numerously. In flight entertainment had an unresponsive touchscreen on this flight, and content was of limited quantity as well. On the inbound sector, we had the Boeing Sky interior. Due to the vast majority of the passengers on that flight being WSC participants from Indonesia, Garuda cabin crew called for a special greeting to them during the pre-flight announcement. The seat remained the same comfortable ones found on the previous flight, however IFE improved with a much faster touchscreen and approximately twice more content. The meal was much better as well, both in terms of presentation and taste. I think Garuda has done a very good job at producing flavourful food, even in Economy.

Again, flight left the stand on time but we got held in a queue due to bad weather. Once airborne a delicious meal was served by smiling cabin crew.

477,"✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Bali on Garuda Indonesia in Business Class. This was a promo fare and extremely good value for money. The A330 was very new - it still had that new aircraft smell. The business class cabin is configured 1-2-1 across. The seat is well designed and very comfortable with a touch screen control to move the seat to a variety of pre-set positions or adjusted as required. The seat set-up has a separate touch screen controller for the IFE which can additionally be controlled on the touch screen monitor. Due to the fact the aircraft was positioned at a remote gate in Sydney, we had to be bussed to the aircraft which is never a pleasant experience anywhere in the world. The terminal holding area for the bus boarding was full to overflowing with several other flights departing at around the same time – chaotic would be being generous. However, once on board this was all forgotten as we were enveloped with the warm, friendly and professional embrace of the crew. This trip was the first time that I had flown on GA and I did have my reservations, however these were very quickly dispelled. Our crew were attentive without being intrusive, polite and eager to be of service, immaculately presented – a true credit to GA’s training and service standards. On boarding we opted for a pre-take off Champagne (Billecart Salmon) and continued with this post-take off. How could we not have a great flight after such a start? The lunch service was quite simply second to none – streets ahead of QF and CX Business Class and comparable with SQ. It’s fully a la carte (no trolleys ever in the cabin). The glassware is full size not some silly miniature airline imitation of restaurant glassware which was truly a most wonderful surprise. My only comment on the service is that the crew perhaps need to be advised that when pouring wine, less is more. Given that the glasses are quite large, and that 1 in the air is equivalent to 2 on the ground, filling the glass to ¾ full was a bit too much, however I valiantly consumed all that was poured for me. My only criticism is a rather poor selection of English language movies. Given that most airlines these days have on offer hundreds of movies to choose from, I thought the movie selection was quite limited and was thankful that I didn’t have a 24 hour flight to take. I would rate this flight and the GA Business Class product 10 out of 10.

The service was very efficient and polite although there was no real attempt at personalisation which was surprising given that the cabin was only half full. The lie-flat bed is comfortable for sleeping. We arrived in Jakarta on time. However, neither the fast track immigration nor the fast track baggage delivery service worked particularly well - bags for Y class passengers were coming off the main carousel before my cases were delivered to the premium baggage desk.

The  movie selection was great, the system could get some update for more user friendly experience but overall decent.

545,"Flown with Garuda Indonesia, Amsterdam to Semarang via Jakarta return for the first time again in 11 years.  Huge change compared to the previous Garuda. Service was impeccable. Very professional cabin crew. On the outbound flight, my mom didn't like the food and asked for the other meal offered during the meal service. Cabin crew politely came to her and gave her the other meal. To my surprise, after the meal service finished, a senior cabin crew came to her and gave her a complaint form to be filled out (because of the meal), but she eventually didn't hand it in. In my opinion, nothing wrong with the food. Perfectly solved problem for such a small issue. They offer such high standard service nowadays, even for the economy class. The suppose to be short layover was a bit unpleasant. 3 hours delay! But they solved it by offering a free lunch at their lounge. There is zero issue on the inbound flight. Flights were on time, great service and again tasty food. Leg room is decent on their 777-300ER (maybe because I am just 5'7""), the domestic connection flight aircraft 737-800 has decent leg room too, plane was kept clean during the whole flight, ticket price is very competitive and nice ground crew service (slightly overweight luggage on both flights but no extra charge) but a bit grumpy luggage man during the check in at SMG (even a fake smile won't harm you, mister).

Warm smiles all around and attentive crew, sometimes chatty as well. Food options were great, and I was not left hungry. Seat was comfy and clean. Aircraft seemed new and was spotless clean. The IFE, however, was strange. I think they forgot to update this particular aircraft's (PK-GIA, their first 777) movie contents. I flew with a younger aircraft in their fleet (PK-GIE) at an earlier date and I saw a more extensive list of movies, so hopefully Garuda will update them pretty soon on all of their aircrafts.

The boarding and departure was uneventful and on time. The cabin crews were attentive lively and polished. They gave me 2 pieces of bread which were delicious. The flight was practically empty so I had a row for myself I could lean back straighten my legs watching a movie while enjoying a cup of hot tea. Landed smoothly.

609,KUL-CGK-KUL (GA821/818). Flew last April on Economy with the entire family (2 kids and 2 adults). Check-in was brief and smooth. As we boarded the plane we were greeted with friendly smiles by the flight attendants. They were helpful with the kids and carry-on bags. The two kids were given toys (a stuffed animal and a car) which is a rare offerings these days especially on a short haul flight. Seats and catering were very good. We can say the same for the in-flight entertainment cabin ambience and cleanliness.

610,Jakarta to Singapore GA 834. The airline has many new aircraft's and their on board service is good. However their on time departure schedule need vast improvement if they claim to be a 5 star airline. I travel often between Singapore-Jakarta or Jakarta-Singapore sector. Most of the time (about 90%) the airline schedule departure time is not met and delayed. Secondly their public announcement in Jakarta airport is poor and unclear. Punctuality reflects how much one care for its valued passengers. Garuda is far behind in maintaining flight punctuality.,2015-05-16,jakarta singapore ga 834 airline many new aircraft board service good however time departure schedule need vast improvement claim 5 star airline travel often singaporejakarta jakartasingapore sector time 90 airline schedule departure time met delayed secondly public announcement jakarta airport poor unclear punctuality reflect much one care value passenger garuda far behind maintain flight punctuality,Positive

612,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product. Small gripes aside I would use Garuda again.,2015-05-10,lgwamslgw price may day bank holiday weekend fantastic value small gripe cant fully checkin online moment although seat select 24hr prior flight usually honour upon complete checkin airport know garuda work add ability mobile boarding pass mean arrive little early airport even hand baggage complete checkin manually probably issue shorthop sector likely full longhaul flight outbound wasnt issue wasnt much queue inbound considerable queue schiphol economy checkin checkin staff efficient however warm friendly outbound flight left little late short delayed arrival schiphol aircraft immaculately maintain fairly new 777300er 9 abreast layout good comfortable seat interior beautifully design reflective indonesian culture avod ok although comprehensive carrier kept inform pilot announcement english indonesian dutch sector cabin crew great immaculately present crew inbound flight much warmer prefer slight disappointment small snack serve water virtually identical sector whilst dont expect anything shorthaul flight flown lowcost carrier flight cost receive anything full service carrier 5star rating serve standard expect fullservice shorthaul product small gripe aside would use garuda,Positive

614,Jakarta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (JOG) and return for a day-trip to see the Borobudur and Prambanan temples. Reserved their first flight leaving CGK at 5.25 am (I was told that Garuda was more reliable than its competitor Lion Air on this route and that the first flight to JOG always departs on time). Check-in went smoothly. Boarding more or less on time (we were bussed to a 737-800 that was not new but in reasonable shape). However instead of going to the runway the plane was driven to what was basically a parking spot. After a prolonged wait an announcement was made for all passengers to collect their carry-on baggage and disembark. I asked a flight attendant for information and she told me that the plane was broken (weather was not a factor). We were then bussed back to the terminal and directed to a lounge which was very basic smoke-filled (over half the passengers there smoked at some point during the wait) and had minimal food offerings. The flight subsequently left a little more than 3 hours late. The return flight that evening was on time. Both flights were less than 1 hour and uneventful otherwise. Check-in personnel and flight attendants were friendly and efficient. My poor evaluation reflects the very late departure of the first flight which significantly impacted my tour that day. No apology was ever offered to the passengers.,2015-04-19,jakarta cgk yogyakarta jog return daytrip see borobudur prambanan temple reserve first flight leave cgk 525 told garuda reliable competitor lion air route first flight jog always departs time checkin go smoothly boarding less time buss 737800 new reasonable shape however instead go runway plane driven basically parking spot prolong wait announcement make passenger collect carryon baggage disembark ask flight attendant information told plane broken weather factor buss back terminal direct lounge basic smokefilled half passenger smoke point wait minimal food offering flight subsequently left little 3 hour late return flight even time flight less 1 hour uneventful otherwise checkin personnel flight attendant friendly efficient poor evaluation reflect late departure first flight significantly impact tour day apology ever offer passenger,Negative

619,Perth - Gatwick Jan 17 returning Feb 11 business class. This is a quality service with really good times and connections. The seat to and from Perth-Jakarta is a basic business recliner on the 737. We thought the connection in Jakarta would be tight but it was all fine with no rush or hassle apart from the rude Dutch businessmen going home. The cabin staff handled them well. The 777 ER from Jakarta leaves at 01.00 for a 13-14 hour trip to Schiphol. The cabin setup is excellent with solo window seats alternate couples together in the middle or two seats separated. We were together in the middle. The seats mattresses and bedding were as good as Qatar on the same routes - really comfortable but without the pyjamas. The full flat bed was a bit like the Qatar 787 layout and might be a bit tight for anyone over 180cm. Food and drink is good but anyone with any brain is not flying business for this. Equally the lounges are basic at both Gatwick and Jakarta but very acceptable. Business class is about being able to sleep in a comfortable flat bed. They excel. The connections on the way back are also excellent with a close connection in Jakarta and arrival in Perth at 1930. Garuda have certainly set a new standard for this route. Highly recommended.,2015-03-09,perth gatwick jan 17 return feb 11 business class quality service really good time connection seat perthjakarta basic business recliner 737 thought connection jakarta would tight fine rush hassle apart rude dutch businessmen go home cabin staff handle well 777 er jakarta leaf 0100 1314 hour trip schiphol cabin setup excellent solo window seat alternate couple together middle two seat separate together middle seat mattress bedding good qatar route really comfortable without pyjama full flat bed bit like qatar 787 layout might bit tight anyone 180cm food drink good anyone brain fly business equally lounge basic gatwick jakarta acceptable business class able sleep comfortable flat bed excel connection way back also excellent close connection jakarta arrival perth 1930 garuda certainly set new standard route highly recommend,Positive

621,I flew from Sydney - Denpasar return. The flight out was as good as a flight could possibly be (and I've regularly flown Qantas and Singapore business classes). The crew were calm and efficient. Everything was perfect - the food (I chose the Japanese banquet - what a great meal!) seat comfort cleanliness (immaculate toilets with magnifying mirrors - an airline first for me!) amenity kit. The return flight was a little less perfect: departed an hour late (with much confusion re departure gate) make-shift lounge with no alcoholic drinks or much else crew not quite as good. By the time we departed I was starving - I expect most passengers like me would not have had dinner. Crew were focused on taking breakfast orders which was the main meal to served on this fights - 2 hours before landing on a 5 hour flight - doesn't make sense. I was able to get a tasty nasi goring 'snack' and asked them not to wake me until an hour before landing - with coffee and muesli only. Overall I was very impressed with Garuda Business Class and I'm definitely considering flying Garuda Business Class on my next trip to Europe.,2015-03-04,flew sydney denpasar return flight good flight could possibly ive regularly flown qantas singapore business class crew calm efficient everything perfect food chose japanese banquet great meal seat comfort cleanliness immaculate toilet magnify mirror airline first amenity kit return flight little less perfect depart hour late much confusion departure gate makeshift lounge alcoholic drink much else crew quite good time depart starve expect passenger like would dinner crew focus take breakfast order main meal serve fight 2 hour land 5 hour flight doesnt make sense able get tasty nasi gore snack ask wake hour land coffee muesli overall impressed garuda business class im definitely consider fly garuda business class next trip europe,Positive

624,We flew on Christmas eve from London Gatwick - Jakarta - Perth. We arrived at the airport with a voicemail from them stating that we may not be able to get on our connecting flight due to stopping in Amsterdam on the way through. The voicemail told us to ask at the desk when we checked in but they had no idea what was going on either. Onto the flight getting on the plane was a disappointment it was old the seats had stains on and me and my family were seated apart and the crew had no interest in helping us. The meals were either over-cooked or cold the entertainment system needed updating with newer films and games etc. We were in the air for Christmas day and although we did not mind doing this there was no Christmas spirit on the flight not even a 'merry Christmas' from the captain when we landed. I understand that Indonesia is not a country which celebrates Christmas but it just would have been nice for them to acknowledge it. There isn't enough legroom for a long haul flight - if someone in front of you has their seat reclined you've got no chance of getting to sleep yourself. On the way back I was told that only 7kg of hand luggage was allowed even though on the way there there hadn't been a problem this resulted in me having to actually move 1.5 kilos out of my hand luggage to someone else's hand luggage that was in my party! What was the point? I was very disappointed with this airline as a whole.

632,We arrived to Bali from Ireland without any problems and we were excited for our final flight to Brisbane. A half an hour before we were to board our 11.15 flight we were informed that it was cancelled and we would not be flying until 7 am. Told it was due to bad weather. Some passengers were offered a hotel however passengers in transit had to stay in the lounge. At 5.30 the next morning we made our way to our gate where we waited until 7.30 before being informed that our flight was again cancelled. Again transit passengers had to remain in the airport while other passengers were brought to a hotel. During this time we were asked for our passports so that they could be stamped but when they were returned we were informed that we weren't allowed to leave the airport. Eventually we were told we could go to a hotel to freshen up and we would be brought back to the airport at 5 o clock that evening. 5 came and we were informed that we were delayed an hour and would be picked up at 6. Once we arrived at the airport we were soon told that our flight was again cancelled and we were given lots of different excuses. Some people decided to board other flights to Brisbane via Melbourne and Sydney. We returned to the hotel in the hope of getting on a flight the next morning but as we expected it was cancelled again. At long last we eventually got a new boarding pass and awaited our flight. All passengers waiting for the flight were very unsatisfied with the service and the treatment we received some of us were delayed 52 hours and we did not even receive one simple apology.,2015-01-21,arrive bali ireland without problem excite final flight brisbane half hour board 1115 flight inform cancel would fly 7 told due bad weather passenger offer hotel however passenger transit stay lounge 530 next morning make way gate wait 730 inform flight cancel transit passenger remain airport passenger brought hotel time ask passport could stamp return inform werent allow leave airport eventually told could go hotel freshen would brought back airport 5 clock even 5 come inform delayed hour would picked 6 arrive airport soon told flight cancel give lot different excuse people decide board flight brisbane via melbourne sydney return hotel hope get flight next morning expect cancel long last eventually get new boarding pas await flight passenger wait flight unsatisfied service treatment receive us delayed 52 hour even receive one simple apology,Negative
633,CGK to PDG. I flew this route on 28th of December 2014. The check-in was smooth and nothing special to mention here. The plane on this route was a 738 with a two class configuration. Seats were comfortable and spacious. Food was quickly served after the fasten seatbelt signs had been switched off. As it was an early morning flight a continental breakfast was served. The taste was good as well as quality and quantity. Especially compared to the flights within Europe. IFE screen showing movies as well as music and TV shows available. The touch screen was a bit slow but overall very good entertainment for such a short flight. In general an excellent experience and I am looking forward to many more flights.,2015-01-14,cgk pdg flew route 28th december 2014 checkin smooth nothing special mention plane route 738 two class configuration seat comfortable spacious food quickly serve fasten seatbelt sign switch early morning flight continental breakfast serve taste good well quality quantity especially compare flight within europe ife screen show movie well music tv show available touch screen bit slow overall good entertainment short flight general excellent experience look forward many flight,Positive

635,Garuda Indonesia was not my first choice to travel from Europe to Southeast Asia since it just started its LGW- CGK leg in September 2014 and I really did not know what to expect from this brand new routing. Fortunately everything turned out to be really great. LGW-AMS-CGK was a very long road to travel but the entertainment system that Garuda has made the journey bearable. The food was fine but the portion was a bit small for me. We landed in Jakarta about 45 minutes later than scheduled so that we missed our connecting flight to BKK. The ground staff in Jakarta took care everything for us and got us to the next available flight to BKK and even gave us vouchers for one of the airport lounges so that we could get freshened up before boarding. All in all the crew was brilliant and either on the ground or in the air the service was much better than I had expected. I travel at least once a year to Asia especially to Bali and I think Garuda Indonesia would be the best airline to go if I lived in London.,2015-01-11,garuda indonesia first choice travel europe southeast asia since start lgw cgk leg september 2014 really know expect brand new rout fortunately everything turn really great lgwamscgk long road travel entertainment system garuda make journey bearable food fine portion bit small land jakarta 45 minute later schedule miss connect flight bkk ground staff jakarta take care everything us get us next available flight bkk even give us voucher one airport lounge could get freshen boarding crew brilliant either ground air service much well expect travel least year asia especially bali think garuda indonesia would best airline go live london,Positive
636,When I set out to book our family holiday to Australia Garuda come up as the quickest most direct route. They were also very competitive on their pricing and having read some reviews I thought we had a great deal. Anyway I bought 4 tickets flying from Gatwick airport via Jakarta to Sydney with an initial stopover time in Jakarta of 1 and a half hours meaning our total flight time was going to be around 22 hours. Below are the bullet points of what happened since the time we booked our flight these are the ones I can add. I will definitely not be using Garuda again. Flight time changed 6 times. Actual outbound flight became Gatwick to Amsterdam (had to get off the plane and sit in gate for 1 and a half hours) Amsterdam to Jakarta (now a 10 hour stop over) Jakarta to Sydney. Total flight time increased by 10 hours. Inbound flight took the same form. Sydney to Jakarta Jakarta to Amsterdam Amsterdam to UK. 10 hour stopover in Jakarta and another hour and a half in Amsterdam. So added over 10 hours to the journey. Total time lost for both flights = 20+ hours. Most airlines let you check in 24 hours before –Garuda is 12 hours. Our flight was at 1.10pm on the Saturday so we had to check in at 1.10am (set the alarm). Logged in and they basically gave only 18 seats to choose from out of 150+ seats. What is the point? We ended up having to keep the seats they already had allocated to us as there weren't 4 other seats together so it was a complete waste of time getting up and checking in. On talking to others at the airport they couldn't even login at all! The return leg was better from a flight perspective as we knew what we were in for however we could not even check in online this time. There was no online check in facility available although they didn't say this on the website. We stayed up until 11.30pm to be told we couldn't check in online but had to do this at the airport.

637,MEL-CGK on 29 Dec. Have been flying this route on regular basis and as usual the standard of Garuda has always been excellent throughout.

The always-friendly FAs truly went above and beyond in ensuring that the passengers settled into their seats comfortably and our hand-carried luggage are looked after properly. The flight left 20 minutes late due to traffic at MEL but arrived in CGK ahead of schedule. The in-flight food was delicious and IFE was excellent.

New and well maintained aircraft. I'm a difficult one to please and have been spoilt on QF SQ BA and other carriers in First and Business Class but Garuda is now in a class of their own.

Again with a previous domestic flight the four of us were given seat allocations scattered all over the cabin that is until after a long and tedious discussion with service desk. Boarding control was hopeless. No microphone and people jammed up the entrance to hear the announcements only in Bahasa. A large Indonesian party just walked though without boarding control which lead to delays until head counts finally reconciled passenger numbers. Our usual pet hate again. When is Garuda going to enforce carry on baggage restrictions? Passengers brought excessive number of bags that were so overweight that they could not lift the bags into overhead lockers. Just as well they were some tall and strong Caucasians to stow luggage around the cabin. We have learnt our lesson travelling economy class on internal flights in Indonesia with Garuda is not value for money other low fare airlines could not be worse.,2014-12-04,16 nov 14 ga 0410 jakarta denpasar connect international business class flight baggage checked perth previous domestic flight four us give seat allocation scatter cabin long tedious discussion service desk boarding control hopeless microphone people jammed entrance hear announcement bahasa large indonesian party walk though without boarding control lead delay head count finally reconcile passenger number usual pet hate garuda go enforce carry baggage restriction passenger brought excessive number bag overweight could lift bag overhead locker well tall strong caucasian stow luggage around cabin learnt lesson travel economy class internal flight indonesia garuda value money low fare airline could bad,Negative

The service was the usual top notch business class service even in this domestic route and even beer was served which exceeded my thought because Garuda usually doesn't serve any alcoholic drinks in domestic sector. I got Sky Priority benefits to board the aircraft first and when arriving in Kupang there was one person who specially escorted me to arrival gate.

The aircraft was clean and all crew were professional and friendly and the meals were exceptionally good. I have an issue with Garuda in that seem unable to sell me a ticket for this flight but originating in Cardiff (CWL) so I could join the long haul sector in Amsterdam.

The new 777-300ER's are extremely comfortable with a good selection of IFE programs available. The A330-200 on the return Jakarta-Melb leg whilst not having fully flat beds was comfortable and again the ground and in-flight service was impressive.

657,Flew Business Class Melbourne to Denpasar and returned 2 weeks later (flights GA719 and GA718). Was accompanied by my wife (we are in our sixties) adult daughter and her 2 year old son. Flight out was good - ground staff flight crew food entertainment were excellent. Flight back was the exact opposite - 1) spent too long waiting for a delayed flight in the very poor Garuda Business lounge in Denpasar airport. Massively overcrowded and poor facilities. 2) Gate was changed without notice from one close to where we were to Gate 9 at the other end of the airport. Wasn't even announced in the Bus Lounge. 3) after significant hassle with a pram and a 2 year old we eventually reached the Gate to find boarding had commenced (again no announcement). 4) at the Business lane gave the attendant our documentation. He did process that quickly but immediately let other passengers through (both Business and Economy). We were trying to get the stroller checked into the hold pacify a crying toddler at 11.30 at night and get our hand luggage together. People were allowed to almost trample us! Has to very loudly object in order to get some understanding and a bit of consideration. 5) Flight staff were poor did not circulate for drinks meals were poor. 6) on the overnight flight despite valiant attempts none of us managed to get the seat into a comfortable sleeping position.

The service that I am not happy with is their baggage allowance and seat comfort. The allowance that I got was 20k while my Emirates flight I got 30k. Garuda Indonesia is supposed to be the flight that people use who are going on a connecting flight to abroad through Jakarta. If they give us only 20k I don't see any difference of Garuda Indonesia and other low-cost domestic flight e.g. Lion Air.

663,We are just finishing a 5 week trip from Sydney to London. While the aircraft flight and on board crew were all fine and the standard comparable to Etihad and Emirates we were extremely disappointed and inconvenienced by Garuda's decision to stop flying direct to London three months after we booked. Garuda would not offer any compensation or upgrade and changed our outward journey to a day later. This was not possible as we had already booked all our U.K. accommodation and so it would have thrown out our whole itinerary. To keep the same dates as per our original booking Garuda sub-contracted part of our journey with Singapore Airlines outward and Etihad homeward which meant in each case two transfers each way. Highly unsatisfactory resulting in hours of waiting around at airports. I will definitely avoid flying with Garuda in the future.,2014-08-06,finish 5 week trip sydney london aircraft flight board crew fine standard comparable etihad emirate extremely disappointed inconvenienced garuda decision stop fly direct london three month book garuda would offer compensation upgrade change outward journey day later possible already book uk accommodation would thrown whole itinerary keep date per original book garuda subcontract part journey singapore airline outward etihad homeward meant case two transfer way highly unsatisfactory result hour wait around airport definitely avoid fly garuda future,Negative

668,Brisbane-Bali return business. The problem with this service is that a 737 is too small for a 5-6 hour flight. The seats have good pitch for the size of aircraft but they are very old style. The business cabin was only half full on the way out but full on the ways back. The FAs were very pleasant and really did their best but the equipment was not really up to the job. Only one full meal was served and on the return overnight it turned out to be breakfast. There was no warning of this as the standard pattern for air travel is usually a meal one hour after take off and I had expected dinner.

The newest Garuda business seat is largely comparable (the same seat by 95%) with Etihad and Air Berlin business seats. However Garuda inflight entertainment is much better (incl. on-air broadcasting which gives me the possibility to follow world cup games live during the flight). The seat in general is very comfortable and equipped with all state of the art amenities but too short for people >180cm for a comfortable sleep (But it is a matter of opinion).

680,GA 89 with commencement of direct flight between CGK-AMS I finally managed to try the brand new B777-300ER in Y class. The hospitality of the cabin crew is excellent and the service has been great. The meals were very nice what I noticed was that they have introduced a new meal tray which is more appealing however the quantity is still a bit small for the 14-hour flight. The entertainment system has been updated and changed to newer system the touch screen is more responsive and selection of movies and songs are relatively new. Seat-wise the seat is comfortable and homely looking but I still do not find it wide enough for some people. Overall I was very impressed with the service and can't wait for their service between CGK-AMS-LGW.,2014-07-15,ga 89 commencement direct flight cgkams finally manage try brand new b777300er class hospitality cabin crew excellent service great meal nice notice introduce new meal tray appeal however quantity still bit small 14hour flight entertainment system update change newer system touch screen responsive selection movie song relatively new seatwise seat comfortable homely look still find wide enough people overall impressed service cant wait service cgkamslgw,Positive
681,Did two short domestic flight with Garuda Indonesia from Semarang to Denpasar and Denpasar to Jogjakarta. First flight was with Bombardier CRJ-1000 NG was a pleasant flight the aircraft itself beyond my expectation (clean comfortable nice cabin ambience wide window).

I managed to taste all 3 red wines. The seat/flatbed was very comfortable. Surprisingly the old version A330-200 (CGK-SYD) I found more comfortable. Did not watch the IFE on CGK-SYD slept most of the times. But generally I found not many new releases.

Great meals inflight but they did run out of choices which is very disappointing when you pay Executive fares. Offered drinks many times during the flight and anything requested was always delivered quickly and with a smile. Same on return leg. The only negative was on arrival the attendants did not restrain Economy passengers from entering the business cabin - therefore it was quite exhausting trying to disembark and then be ferried by overcrowded buses to the terminal.,2014-03-27,syddpssyd business class access qantas club lounge sydney airport great a330200 great business product comfortable seat amazingly good legroom seat width great meal inflight run choice disappoint pay executive fare offer drink many time flight anything request always deliver quickly smile return leg negative arrival attendant restrain economy passenger enter business cabin therefore quite exhaust try disembark ferry overcrowd bus terminal,Positive
709,Inboard business class service is very good with a good choice of meals if you want a drink you should be prepared to ask several times. Onboard crew know nothing about ground services at all. Despite double checking with call centre on arrival from transit resulted in an additional visa on arrival USD 25.00. Bus to connecting flight pay yet more tax. Go through immigration and advised cannot take water into departure lounge. This only happens Jakarta to Singapore. Get hotel to print out boarding pass for departure to Australia get to the airport and told you need another boarding pass. Business class lounge very basic yes I know they are doing renovations but they are also doing the same renovations in Denpasar so again very basic and don't even think of asking for a drink. Transfer from Jakarta to Denpasar not my request but the only flight on this day. Dropped off at the Domestic Arrival and told to find own way to International approx 15 minutes walk. Off to immigration but told you must pay more tax so far the cost of the tickets has risen by over USD 100.00 just to transit. Not all problems are Garuda's taxes are government but passengers must be fully informed. Transit passengers should be assisted not abandoned. If a Garuda is serious about creating a better reputation it must address information services and passenger assistance.,2014-03-25,inboard business class service good good choice meal want drink prepared ask several time onboard crew know nothing ground service despite double check call centre arrival transit result additional visa arrival usd 2500 bus connect flight pay yet tax go immigration advise take water departure lounge happens jakarta singapore get hotel print boarding pas departure australia get airport told need another boarding pas business class lounge basic yes know renovation also renovation denpasar basic dont even think ask drink transfer jakarta denpasar request flight day drop domestic arrival told find way international approx 15 minute walk immigration told must pay tax far cost ticket risen usd 10000 transit problem garuda tax government passenger must fully inform transit passenger assist abandon garuda serious create well reputation must address information service passenger assistance,Positive

Although the seat was a little bit narrow with not much storage space I still managed to have a decent sleep. The IFE had a good selection of movies and was relatively easy to use. Service came with a wonderful smile and warm Indonesian hospitality. It is obvious that recently Garuda has been investing a lot into hardware and it shows. There are still small details that can be improved upon such as a fluffier pillow and non-synthetic blanket however this is a very competitive product.,2014-03-17,board overnight bali tokyo flight garuda a330300 expect much pleasant surprise plane brand new flatbed expect although seat little bit narrow much storage space still manage decent sleep ife good selection movie relatively easy use service come wonderful smile warm indonesian hospitality obvious recently garuda invest lot hardware show still small detail improve upon fluffier pillow nonsynthetic blanket however competitive product,Positive
712,A330-300 from Amsterdam and return (GA 88-89 respectively). The flight had a short transit in AUH which for me was pretty cumbersome and tiring to get out of the plane after several hours in the aircraft. Fortunately the service was great the selection of meals were unique as they combined western and Indonesian menu. The cabin crew were responsive and professional in a way of treating and comforting passengers but the entertainment system was pretty disappointing. The movies were limited and the touch screen was not really responsive.

Carrying one boy in one hand with a cabin bag and another boy was not easy! I was informed by check-in staff that we would be served a kids meal but later on flight attendants said they didn't have any. No toys or enough inflight entertainment available for kids either.

I took the morning flight because I will continue my trip to another city in Indonesia the flight was scheduled at 7.25 am but the fact was the aircraft arrived from CGK at 7.30 am so the flight was delayed about 30 minutes. Fortunately the cabin crews apologized about the delay and served the passengers friendly. Another problem I found when the arrival even though the aircraft landed smoothly the aircraft parked in the remote area and we need to go to the Arrival terminal by bus that provided by them. Actually it would be ok if the weather was good but in the condition of heavy rain like I did it wasn't supposed to be parked in the remote area.,2014-03-03,ga299 bkscgk take morning flight continue trip another city indonesia flight schedule 725 fact aircraft arrive cgk 730 flight delayed 30 minute fortunately cabin crew apologize delay serve passenger friendly another problem found arrival even though aircraft land smoothly aircraft park remote area need go arrival terminal bus provide actually would ok weather good condition heavy rain like wasnt suppose park remote area,Positive

Slept the whole flight so can't comment on IFE or food except to say when I woke a crew immediately offered hot or cold drink. Toilets spotless.

718,GA 721 then GA 439 BNE-DPS-CGK. Flying back 11 days later on GA 400 then GA 720 CGK-DPS-BNE all on B737-800NG. In every aspect the experience couldn't be more than four stars. Smooth check-in at Brisbane Airport with my bag tagged all the way for Jakarta but it had to be picked up at Denpasar for customs clearance then dropped off at their domestic terminal. Garuda uses their narrow-body fleet on this 5hrs flight meaning that it cannot fly on full load you are guaranteed more space to stretch out in economy. The cabin and toilets were immaculately clean and the seat pitch exceeded expectations. You are served a drink before take-off. The service from the cabin crew seemed rushed however and I feel there should be improvements with their English. Meals served on board were plentiful you'll even get a three-course meal on the 1hr45mn DPS-CGK flight. My only tip with Garuda is to pack your own IFE as their options may not be to everyone's taste and they are prone to glitches. Another thing is to bring your own headphones because the ones provided by Garuda had poor sound quality you couldn't hear anything over the engines and unfortunately this was a consistent problem on all of the four flights that I took with Garuda.,2014-02-19,ga 721 ga 439 bnedpscgk fly back 11 day later ga 400 ga 720 cgkdpsbne b737800ng every aspect experience couldnt four star smooth checkin brisbane airport bag tag way jakarta picked denpasar custom clearance drop domestic terminal garuda us narrowbody fleet 5hrs flight meaning fly full load guaranteed space stretch economy cabin toilet immaculately clean seat pitch exceed expectation serve drink takeoff service cabin crew seem rush however feel improvement english meal serve board plentiful youll even get threecourse meal 1hr45mn dpscgk flight tip garuda pack ife option may everyones taste prone glitch another thing bring headphone one provide garuda poor sound quality couldnt hear anything engine unfortunately consistent problem four flight take garuda,Negative

Very comfortable seat not quite horizontal but by far the best option out of the three airlines plying this route and although an early start from Melbourne we checked into our Ubud hotel at 2pm so it really gives you that extra bit of time to enjoy Bali. No on board immigration on ex Melbourne flights. Also our preferred seats were marked as occupied during on line check in and were empty so if you don't get the seat you prefer try asking at check in for them. In summary great seat and service good IFE OK food and wine best option for this route in business class and definitely recommend.,2014-02-19,ga719 meldps 17214 flight empty 6 36 business check take minute passenger wait qantas business lounge melbourne great place relax good breakfast selection flight depart right schedule arrive 30 minute early board service extremely attentive amenity kit contain useful item food ok lunch serve chip chocolate cup noodle offer throughout flight snack toilet spotless good entertainment selection comfortable seat quite horizontal far best option three airline ply route although early start melbourne checked ubud hotel 2pm really give extra bit time enjoy bali board immigration ex melbourne flight also prefer seat marked occupy line check empty dont get seat prefer try ask check summary great seat service good ife ok food wine best option route business class definitely recommend,Positive
720,Flew from SYD-CGK (GA713) CGK-PDG (GA162) PDG-CGK (GA163) CGK-SYD (GA 712). For international flights we got offered either orange juices or apple juices. The meal was really tasty! We also received a light meal (ie. small bread) and an ice cream at the beginning of the flight and just before the captain commencing the descend. As for the domestic on one of my flight from PDG-CGK we even got free in-flight entertainment (I never found any free in-flight entertainment during other domestic flights). The other highlights are: the immigration on board from Sydney the spacious legroom the extra baggage allowance (we got 30kg whilst most of the other airline only allow us to carry 23kg) the very friendly flight attendants a lot of new movies on their in-flight entertainment 24/7 customer services (in Indonesia) and the on-time flight schedule.,2014-02-18,flew sydcgk ga713 cgkpdg ga162 pdgcgk ga163 cgksyd ga 712 international flight get offer either orange juice apple juice meal really tasty also receive light meal ie small bread ice cream begin flight captain commence descend domestic one flight pdgcgk even get free inflight entertainment never found free inflight entertainment domestic flight highlight immigration board sydney spacious legroom extra baggage allowance get 30kg whilst airline allow us carry 23kg friendly flight attendant lot new movie inflight entertainment 247 customer service indonesia ontime flight schedule,Positive
721,SIN-CGK GA829 on Feb 11th. A smooth flight operated by 737-800NG with comfortable seats nice and smiling crew members and on time departure and arrival. Price was 50% lower than SQ and this is why I chose Garuda. On the minus side: they ran out of chicken when they got to my row so I did not have lunch (I cannot eat seafood): the hostess was very apologetic and try to get me something else even though at the end it was not possible but I did not starve during a 1.5 hr trip. In Jakarta the plane was parked at a remote stand forcing us to have a rather long bus ride. On the plus side: check-in at Changi was a breeze as was going through immigration and customs in Soekarno-Hatta and seat pitch and softness is above average for economy. I have to mention that I had troubles when trying to buy the ticket in their website as the page got frozen when processing the payment: and after trying several times I had to give up and purchase it through an agency at a higher price. Anyway considering the level of service and the value for money I will probably consider to fly with them again in the future.,2014-02-13,sincgk ga829 feb 11th smooth flight operate 737800ng comfortable seat nice smile crew member time departure arrival price 50 low sq chose garuda minus side ran chicken get row lunch eat seafood hostess apologetic try get something else even though end possible starve 15 hr trip jakarta plane park remote stand force us rather long bus ride plus side checkin changi breeze go immigration custom soekarnohatta seat pitch softness average economy mention trouble try buy ticket website page get frozen processing payment try several time give purchase agency high price anyway consider level service value money probably consider fly future,Positive

727,On Saturday October 12th 2013 we arrived 3 hours before our planned departure to Hong Kong on GA860 only to be told that the plane was delayed however they did not say that it would be 6+ hours delay. Check in was chaotic to say the least and customer service could not be found. After 1 hour we were allowed to check in so we proceeded to temporary lounge which was over flowing with people and nowhere to sit.

729,GA878 CGK-ICN 4 Jan 2014. The check-in at CGK airport was seamless. We didnt have to queue up for the immigration - a great plus. The Business class lounge is dreadful. In fact it was nicer at the gate lounge where the air was fresher. The F&B at the lounge was very disappointing. I think GA really needs to work on this in order to be able to compete with other 5 stars airlines. Flight delayed the boarding process was appalling. There is no C class dedicated line. I understand CGK airport is very congested but we were made to wait for transport bus for more than 15mins. There were no staff. I thought as C class passengers you will receive a better service in this area. Once we were on board the service seems to be a lot better. Credit to all the cabin crews. The CSM doesn't seem to do much at all. Onboard Food presentation is superb however it didn't feel as fresh as it could possibly be. Entertainment is very limited but being a night flight we didn't really use it. I also noticed the flight path program which i personally like was not available. Seat is comfortable and I slept. A nice touch when I discovered a crew had placed a blanket over me when I woke up. Breakfast was good. Flight landed smoothly at ICN.

A woman carried her crying baby was still walking around trying to calm the baby down while the aircraft was moving and seatbelt sign was already on. CA didn't warn her to sit down. The entertainment didn't work. GA0323 on 3rd Jan 2014 also delayed approx. 1.5 hours. Isn't it probably better to rearrange the schedule and fly on time?

765,PER - DPS. Good flight. Plenty of room as plane was only 1/3 full so we were given 3 seats up front for the two of us. The dinner was good for airline food. I found I could not watch the inflight entertainment as the sound level was so low and the headphones they give you do not fit well. I tried turning the sound up but was still not loud enough. The other strange thing is that they did not offer tea or coffee after dinner. Compared with the other airlines on this route Garuda offers a lot more space and comfort and as the other airlines increase their price Garuda is becoming very competitive.,2013-08-11,per dp good flight plenty room plane 13 full give 3 seat front two us dinner good airline food found could watch inflight entertainment sound level low headphone give fit well try turn sound still loud enough strange thing offer tea coffee dinner compare airline route garuda offer lot space comfort airline increase price garuda become competitive,Positive

The 737-800 was very nice with clean lavatory and sleek clean exterior. Meal was alright with the traditional Indonesian food. Swift boarding and disembarking throughout all legs. The flight from Hong Kong to Jakarta was also nice overall. Clean lavatory and had a decent meal too. The AVOD was terrible. It didn't respond very well and the person in front of me had to suffer the consequences. Outdated and needs to be updated.

The only bad point for my trip: I've waited for almost 45 minutes to get my luggage and thought they lost it. But actually they made a mistake by placing my luggage in the ""executive class passengers"" part of the arrival point.

770,CGK-ICN-CGK on GA's newest A330. Both flights leave on time. Welcome drink on economy class is a very nice touch. Cabin crews are excellent as they constantly smile regularly walk through the cabin to make sure everything is fine and being helpful. Their language skill is also excellent; all Korean cabin crews onboard are even able to speak Bahasa Indonesia clearly. The inflight entertainment is pretty outdated although it still has plenty of good movies to watch. The seat is very comfortable and has plenty of legroom but it has no legrest. Inflight meal is delicious they even serve the Korean ginseng chicken meal on my return flight. The immigration onboard is amazing and saves my time a lot upon my arrival at CGK. However GA should improve their amenity kits. They should add kits more than a pair of socks and a blindfold. Garuda should also serve hot towels which are better than the cold towels that are currently being served for economy passengers.,2013-07-29,cgkicncgk gas new a330 flight leave time welcome drink economy class nice touch cabin crew excellent constantly smile regularly walk cabin make sure everything fine helpful language skill also excellent korean cabin crew onboard even able speak bahasa indonesia clearly inflight entertainment pretty outdated although still plenty good movie watch seat comfortable plenty legroom legrest inflight meal delicious even serve korean ginseng chicken meal return flight immigration onboard amaze save time lot upon arrival cgk however ga improve amenity kit add kit pair sock blindfold garuda also serve hot towel well cold towel currently serve economy passenger,Positive
771,I recently took flight and have been very impressed with Garuda Indonesia. In the fasting month of Ramadan most Indonesians Muslims don't eat during the daytime and we are offered boxes to carry our inflight meal. This service has impressed me a lot as Garuda Indonesia has been committed to constantly give better service for their passengers even in this special occasion. Cabin crew are also very friendly and smiley they always give the nice greetings and service for all passengers. The only con I had might be the check-in system on CGK as the system migration has not been fully adopted the check-in was late and the ground staff were not really standby during the process. Meanwhile the inflight entertainment is not updated compared to other airlines.,2013-07-23,recently take flight impressed garuda indonesia fast month ramadan indonesian muslim dont eat daytime offer box carry inflight meal service impressed lot garuda indonesia commit constantly give well service passenger even special occasion cabin crew also friendly smiley always give nice greeting service passenger con might checkin system cgk system migration fully adopt checkin late ground staff really standby process meanwhile inflight entertainment update compare airline,Positive

Even though at that time GA encountered problems due to system migration but the agent managed the trip very well. Onboard the aircraft the cabin crew were sweet and charming and seemed to be very professional. The entertainment system must be upgraded though as well as English announcement made by the cabin crew.

788,Yesterday 11 June I flew business class on GA 417 from Denpasar to Jakarta. The in flight service was excellent we left on time clean new plane and good food but on landing the ground handling was extremely bad. After disembarking we had a long walk through the terminal and then had to board buses this is normal but still irritating however this time we had to wait a long time for the buses to arrive a small executive bus arrived first and business class passengers were pushed aside by everyone trying to get on the bus at the same time until it was so packed that it became unsafe. No Garuda ground staff were supervising.

Return flight from Jakarta to Melbourne and I was pleasantly surprised by their level of service. Departing flight GA 716 on Airbus 332 check in smooth and departed on time. On board service pleasant and efficient - welcome drinks served before take off - cabin crew were approachable but not overtly friendly. Thanks to the relatively empty aircraft I managed to sleep throughout the red-eye flight. Breakfast of omelette and sausages was tasty. On returning journey 6 hour flight I watched 2 movies and a short sketch on their VOD system. Selection of movies was decent. In addition to main meals mangoes/blueberry Ice cream was served before landing in Denpasar/Bali My only criticism is the connecting flight arrangement in Bali. I had to take my luggage out before proceeding to the domestic lounge. Although I had staff assisting me the whole process was indeed unnecessary. They should provide connecting passengers with check-in baggage service to their final destinations.

Airline did not inform us about the check-in relocation which was the domestic wing of an unfinished new terminal. There the check-in was longer but it could not be helped due to the missing equipment for the staff based in an unfinished terminal. Boarding the A333 was pleasant first time boarding one since improvement of their airline their aircraft usually serves medium-haul flights and the airplane feels spacious despite a high seating capacity that could've made seat comfort difficult. Staff were very attentive onboard. IFE was limited however as programs were blocked due to the route served.

808,Jakarta - Sydney on 19 March. I requested an exit row seat on this overnight flight and was pleased when the check-in agent said that would be no problem at all. Very disappointed to discover that my seat turned out to be nothing of the sort - it was in fact the very last row on the aircraft right next to the noisy galley and toilets which made it difficult to sleep. Other than that the flight was quite good - a small late-night snack was served and a decent breakfast before landing. There's a rather modest offering of movies/TV shows - OK for a 7 hour flight. Cabin crew was up to Garuda's usual high standard.,2013-03-28,jakarta sydney 19 march request exit row seat overnight flight pleased checkin agent say would problem disappointed discover seat turn nothing sort fact last row aircraft right next noisy galley toilet make difficult sleep flight quite good small latenight snack serve decent breakfast land there rather modest offering moviestv show ok 7 hour flight cabin crew garuda usual high standard,Negative

The meal selections were okay and nothing special for the trip. Cabin crew were attentive and chatty but they're also very professional and friendly. The main gripe was check-in process in Jeddah which was very chaotic and there's no executive class counter. The price at this sector was very reasonable for executive class however GA must really improve their service in CGK-JED-CGK sector which is still abandoned than other sectors of GA.,2013-03-14,fly cgkjed return ga executive class aircraft 747400 age aircraft clean service quite standard business class meal selection okay nothing special trip cabin crew attentive chatty theyre also professional friendly main gripe checkin process jeddah chaotic there executive class counter price sector reasonable executive class however ga must really improve service cgkjedcgk sector still abandon sector ga,Positive

Ground and in-flight service was impeccable food and drink were of exemplary quality. There was plenty of space with comfortable seats. In-flight entertainment was a limited but the movies were good quality. The best feature was the in-flight immigration service so no queuing on arrival at DPS.

812,I and my wife flew from SYD to JKT on 17 Dec and returned to SYD on 7 Jan 2013. We also did a few travels with Garuda domestically within Indonesia. I observed a major improvement in services provided by Garuda. The quality consistency has been great. Firstly the ticket prices were quite affordable given it was a peak holiday season (i.e. Christmas and NY). The departures have been on-time. Services on-board were quite good. Food was alright and entertainment was up-to-date. The cabin crews were friendly and attentive. The immigration on-board made it easy for passenger to avoid long queue at Jakarta's airport. Most importantly these services have been so consistent from one Garuda flight to the other. We can only conclude that Garuda is clearly improved.,2013-03-01,wife flew syd jkt 17 dec return syd 7 jan 2013 also travel garuda domestically within indonesia observe major improvement service provide garuda quality consistency great firstly ticket price quite affordable give peak holiday season ie christmas ny departure ontime service onboard quite good food alright entertainment uptodate cabin crew friendly attentive immigration onboard make easy passenger avoid long queue jakarta airport importantly service consistent one garuda flight conclude garuda clearly improve,Positive
813,SUB-CGK on Jan 23 and CGK-SUB on Jan 25 using the new Boeing 737-800NG after discovering a promo for the tickets. Check-in at Juanda Airport Surabaya was neat although check-in at Soekarno-Hatta Airport Jakarta was faster due to the dedicated check-in counter for GFF Silver (I am a holder of Garuda Frequent Flyer - Silver). Seat was okay for departure but seat for return was much fine. Surprisingly in-flight entertainment was up-to-date for both routes which was different than the previous time I used the airline for the same route. For this short route passengers should be given more portion for the in-flight food. I will travel again with Garuda Indonesia because of the reliable price and service. I'm hoping that next time Garuda will use Airbus A330-200 aircraft for this busiest route in Indonesia.,2013-02-25,subcgk jan 23 cgksub jan 25 use new boeing 737800ng discover promo ticket checkin juanda airport surabaya neat although checkin soekarnohatta airport jakarta faster due dedicate checkin counter gff silver holder garuda frequent flyer silver seat okay departure seat return much fine surprisingly inflight entertainment uptodate route different previous time use airline route short route passenger give portion inflight food travel garuda indonesia reliable price service im hop next time garuda use airbus a330200 aircraft busiest route indonesia,Positive

815,CGK-DPS on a 738 DPS-CGK on a 333. First flight's check-in was mediocre not perfect nor horrible. One of my passengers forced me to sit in the emergency aisle the design of the arm rests for the emergency aisle seats make leg comfort too tight. Food was excellent and crew are very attentive. IFE content was limited on board due to the flight being a regional trip but is updated nonetheless. Flight was quick and on time. Second flight was on board an uncommon aircraft which allowed me to see inside their mid-haul fleet. Check- in is slow but this could be a result of the ongoing renovation of DPS. I was able to not sit in the emergency aisle. Seat pitch on board the 333 is very good fits tall passengers. Seat layout of 2-4-2 does not make seating tight another big plus. Attentive FA excellent food but IFE is limited again. The seat did not provide a USB gate even though the IFE menu has the option to access media from the USB. Great flight though.

Both legs served by fairly new B738 with acceptable comfort and attentive service carried out by smiling and professional crew. Flights on time and check-in took less than 10minutes both in Jakarta and Yogjakarta. Would surely fly them again for domestic flights in Indonesia in the future and probably would also give them a chance for a long-haul trip.,2013-02-12,two shorthaul flight last week cgkjog ga208 back 2 day later board ga217 leg serve fairly new b738 acceptable comfort attentive service carry smile professional crew flight time checkin take less 10minutes jakarta yogjakarta would surely fly domestic flight indonesia future probably would also give chance longhaul trip,Positive
817,CGK-MLG-CGK on Boeing 737-500. Both flights on time. Since 737-500 is an old plane there is no VOD or other inflight entertainment.

The only disappointment - both sectors missed out the pre-ordered Child meal even though it was booked and printed on our tickets. The food portion a bit small and tasteless. Entertainment response slow on the older A330-200. Onboard immigration facilities is great. Save a lot of time and hassle on the long queue at CGK.

It was not flat bed but cradle seat instead it was quite comfortable though. Service was efficient and courteous. IFE was sufficient on their touch screen personal TV. The choice of menu was great I always choose Indonesian cuisine. Toiletry bag headphones and menu distributed upon arrival plus the welcome drinks. All sectors had the same plane (12 seats in business class) I must say I was impressed by the whole experience take off and landing were smooth and on time.

823,JKT-DPS-SIN. Flight to Denpasar from Jakarta left on time and cabin service was fine. Flight to Singapore from Denpasar delayed by 4 hours because of the late arrival of the plane. I find this unacceptable because this particular sector which leaves Denpasar at 7.05 pm is codeshared with KLM and SQ. The plane had to serve the Jakarta-Yogyakarta-Denpasar sector before flying to Singapore. It could not land in Yogyakarta because of bad weather and had to be diverted to Surabaya where it waited for 2 hours until the weather was clear. Then it flew to Yogyakarta before heading to Denpasar. I arrived in Singapore at 1.20 am on Monday instead of 9.20 pm on Sunday.,2013-01-18,jktdpssin flight denpasar jakarta left time cabin service fine flight singapore denpasar delayed 4 hour late arrival plane find unacceptable particular sector leaf denpasar 705 pm codeshared klm sq plane serve jakartayogyakartadenpasar sector fly singapore could land yogyakarta bad weather divert surabaya wait 2 hour weather clear flew yogyakarta head denpasar arrive singapore 120 monday instead 920 pm sunday,Negative

825,PER-DPS return. As per previous reviews - your Garuda experience depends on where you get on the plane. We were once again delivered a mediocre check-in at Perth International on the early afternoon flight on the 27th of December. They are more interested in checking in economy passengers at the business class check- in. When someone at economy check-in waved us over it resulted in a long very delayed check-in because the clerk had to keep walking over to the business class check-in for lounge passes etc. The Qantas lounge ran out of food when we got there and when I brought that to the receptionist's attention I was informed that there would be more food in 5 minutes. The 5 minutes turned out to be an hour. Normal chaotic boarding followed - no priority boarding for business class. Service on board was good except the cabin staff allowed economy class passengers to use the business class toilet and did not even try to prevent it. Back to Perth on 3 January early morning flight. They forgot to load the menus and we had to ask them for drinks during the flight - it was not offered on their own accord. Garuda is starting to drop the ball and as their prices are not very competitive anymore I think that I would start looking at other airlines' premium class offering to Bali. Garuda's inconsistent service offering in their premium class on this route is just not worth the money anymore.,2013-01-16,perdps return per previous review garuda experience depends get plane deliver mediocre checkin perth international early afternoon flight 27th december interested check economy passenger business class check someone economy checkin wave us result long delayed checkin clerk keep walk business class checkin lounge pass etc qantas lounge ran food get brought receptionist attention inform would food 5 minute 5 minute turn hour normal chaotic boarding follow priority boarding business class service board good except cabin staff allow economy class passenger use business class toilet even try prevent back perth 3 january early morning flight forgot load menu ask drink flight offer accord garuda start drop ball price competitive anymore think would start look airline premium class offering bali garuda inconsistent service offering premium class route worth money anymore,Positive

It was a red-eye flight and I found it a bit strange that the FAs did not circulate the cabin with water and light beverages overnight as they usually do. The IFE had a fair choice of current movies as well as a good selection of short features. Food was adequate although the portion was a little on the small side.

848,Jakarta - Taipei. Garuda now have a dedicated business class check in area at Jakarta airport once checked in an agent escorts you directly to the lounge completes your departure card and deals with immigration formalities for you returning 10 minutes later with your passport stamped. Outbound flight was overnight and not particularly comfortable as they use B737-800 which has very limited recline even in business class so difficult to sleep. Service was good (and the J cabin was full) but quite limited as most passengers just wanted to sleep. Substantial breakfast served before arrival into Taipei. Return flight was daytime and very nice. Garuda uses the CAL Dynasty lounge at Taipei airport. Snacks served on take off and then a full lunch service a couple of hours later. Champagne and decent selection of wines offered. Given a fast pass immigration card so no need to queue upon arrival at Soekarno Hatta which was a big bonus as queues at immigration were very long. Business class luggage was delivered quite quickly by hand to a priority luggage bay near carousel. Overall very good indeed and very reasonable fare of USD 770 return.,2012-11-15,jakarta taipei garuda dedicate business class check area jakarta airport checked agent escort directly lounge completes departure card deal immigration formality return 10 minute later passport stamp outbound flight overnight particularly comfortable use b737800 limited recline even business class difficult sleep service good j cabin full quite limited passenger want sleep substantial breakfast serve arrival taipei return flight daytime nice garuda us cal dynasty lounge taipei airport snack serve take full lunch service couple hour later champagne decent selection wine offer give fast pas immigration card need queue upon arrival soekarno hatta big bonus queue immigration long business class luggage deliver quite quickly hand priority luggage bay near carousel overall good indeed reasonable fare usd 770 return,Positive
849,6 November GA 719 Melbourne to Denpasar 2 hours late. Because of delay in turn around plane was not properly cleaned. The food was substandard even for Indonesian cuisine and the choice was fish or fish. Inflight Entertainment selection is poor and focussed on Asian Movies.

855,"We travelled Sydney to Denpensar Denpensar to Hong Kong and then Hong Kong back to Sydney via Jakarta. All business class. Sydney flight all smooth sailing they ran out of champange - but it was the weekend and it was a plane of Auzzies! Heading to Hong Kong from Denpensar was a bit like entering the set of ""Faulty Towers"" We had jam covered seats moved to broken seats then were moved back to another row of dirty seats - all the time being told ""so sorry"" but no-one thought to actually wipe down the armrest in the middle and actually clean it. Which I did myself in the end turning a lovely white napkin into a deep shade of grey. The food was also very average bland and woudl not rate the freshness factor of the bread rolls served. The constant ""sorry"" but no effort to clean correct or offer any compensation (I remember travelling Singapore airlines enconomy class with a broken Screen - straight away I was offered a $50 duty free voucher - not a big gesture but it made the difference in my perception of the trip). On this leg of the trip we paid full price used real money and in return did not receive a business class experience. We are now travelling the last leg Hong Kong back to Sydney via Jakarta. The seats work oddly enough the dirty armrest status has not changed. The food on this leg was good mango salsa and prawns was a delightful flavour sensation.

857,August 2012 - excellent service. I flew to Bali - only $100 more than JetStar but had baggage and meals included. The Cabin Crew were hospitable. We were given welcome drinks in economy menus pillows blankets amenity kits toothbrushes in the rest rooms newspapers. Clean modern aircraft - the plane was not full and check in staff blocked the seat next to me so I had 2 seats to myself on the way over and back. Enjoyed the A330 where you are only ever one seat from aisle in economy. Plenty of leg room - I could easily cross my legs in economy.

859,My wife and I flew from Sydney to Denpasar (Bali) return on an A330. Aircraft's were modern and clean and tidy inside. The cabin crew were all well groomed polite and gave excellent service. Our flights left 10-25 mins late but this delay was mostly made up on route. Before takeoff given drinks and meals were a nice quality and nice quality. On the return journey they had run out of choices by the time they got to our seats but the cabin crew made sure that we got first pick of the croissants and breads. Another really good service that Garuda offer is on board passport control. 2 immigration officers travel on the flight and do the passport and immigration procedures on the aircraft during the flight and Garuda collect the fee on their behalf. This service as far as I know is only between Australia and Indonesia. This made the process of passing through the airport quick and efficient. Areas where I think they could improve further: My wife and I found the seat backs to be a little hard on the return journey I would like to see the inflight info (speed location etc - map) on our seat back screens. No web check in was available and I would like to see the option of selecting seats at booking. I found it annoying and inconvenient having to be taken between the aircraft and Denpasar terminal by bus and would like to see Garuda use the jet bridges. Would I fly with Garuda again? Yes!

878,Singapore via Denpasar. Upon check-in at Perth on Saturday 7 July we were informed that we had to collect our bags in Denpasar and clear immigration - despite the fact that we were given boarding passes for our connecting flight to Singapore on the same day. When I enquired about the lounge passes we were informed that Garuda had no lounge in Denpasar. Having arrived we cleared customs but were unable to collect our bags - these had been correctly transferred and would be on the flight to Singapore with us later in the day. Somehow we missed the rep that was sent to collect us at the gate as we were transferring. Flights to Denpasar and later to Singapore were of a very high standard except for some very annoying children in the business class cabin I had to ask the parents to contain their two toddlers who were being real nuisances. Service and food on both flight were excellent and we were addressed by name at all times. Flight from Singapore to Bali on the 10th of July also excellent. However - flight from Denpasar to Perth on the 13th of July was average to poor - we had to ask for everything (wet towels drinks etc.). No menus distributed and staff rushed through the lunch service as soon as possible after take-off and then spent the rest of the 3.5 flight hiding behind the curtain. This is unacceptable for business class service. Garuda really needs to get the business class staff to step up their service on this route. We will be flying again in October and it will be interesting to see whether there is any improvement on the Denpasar - Perth route.,2012-07-15,singapore via denpasar upon checkin perth saturday 7 july inform collect bag denpasar clear immigration despite fact give boarding pass connect flight singapore day enquire lounge pass inform garuda lounge denpasar arrive clear custom unable collect bag correctly transfer would flight singapore us later day somehow miss rep sent collect us gate transfer flight denpasar later singapore high standard except annoy child business class cabin ask parent contain two toddler real nuisance service food flight excellent address name time flight singapore bali 10th july also excellent however flight denpasar perth 13th july average poor ask everything wet towel drink etc menu distribute staff rush lunch service soon possible takeoff spent rest 35 flight hiding behind curtain unacceptable business class service garuda really need get business class staff step service route fly october interest see whether improvement denpasar perth route,Positive

Great B735 interior and comfort entertainment was OK though it was only 'Just For Laughs' screened on the overhead TVs but it's understandable since it's a short flight. Newspapers were offered as reading materials in addition to meals and choices of drinks. The only lack was that the male flight attendant did not smile at all.

884,Return flights from Perth to Osaka KIX via Denpasar Bali in business class. Flights were OK clean aircraft good seats meal selection geared to Asian audience good wine selection. Service uneven but not indifferent. However the stops in Bali (6 hours outward and 3 hrs inbound) reveal an area for vast improvement. The business lounge at Denpasar is not worthy of the name and airport authorities can be very unpleasant.

886,Flew SYD-AMS return last month. Very inexpensive fare what you would pay with a legacy carrier in Premium Eco. From start to finish an excellent experience. Qantas Club access in Sydney. New A330-200 up to CGK and onto AMS. Seat very comfortable in upright recline and lie-flat position - able to get quite a bit of sleep. Warm welcome onboard with refills of drinks before departure. Food choice and quality more than enough for all legs. Lounge in JKT very chic with warm surrounds. Crown Lounge used in AMS. IFE very easy to use with wide variety of choice. The real difference is a genuine sense of caring for their passengers. Small problem on return with points being added to wife's FF account. 1 call to SYD office to fix problem a week ago. Today new card reflecting Gold status delivered to home address from CGK by courier. Yes the leg home takes a little longer due to lay-over in Jakarta but for the price and service nothing beats it.

Wide range of drinks and beverages was offered on and after meal service. Polite and very helpful is well known for their FA's pilots very informative. AVOD was good but they need to add more current movies and music. Also the AVOD was sometimes unresponsive with its touch screen system which made it difficult to use.

894,SIN-DPS-SIN. Flight was on-time food was nice flight attendants friendly. The only downside of it was the aircon - not working properly while waiting for take-off. Passengers were left sweating for almost 20 mins. Flight back to SIN was delayed for almost 30 mins then once onboard there were problems with the electrical system. We were waiting almost 20 mins until being told to leave the aircraft because they needed to change the plane. There seemed to be a problem with co-ordination with the ground team. We were told to wait - after 20 mins - asked to queue for the meal - only to be told to move back to the gate to board the plane after 10 mins. Knowing that the problem still persisted - they finally gave in to change the plane - why waste our time then? One last thing the in-flight entertainment was not good - there were few new movies - but other that old and movies I had never heard before. The touch screen navigation was clunky and my console restarted repeatedly while playing the movies - forcing me to watch the ads again and fast forwarding to the last point. Regardless all the issues I feel Garuda has done a very good job in transforming from where it was 5-10 years ago however definitely there are plenty more rooms to improve.,2012-06-19,sindpssin flight ontime food nice flight attendant friendly downside aircon work properly wait takeoff passenger left sweat almost 20 min flight back sin delayed almost 30 min onboard problem electrical system wait almost 20 min told leave aircraft need change plane seem problem coordination ground team told wait 20 min ask queue meal told move back gate board plane 10 min know problem still persist finally give change plane waste time one last thing inflight entertainment good new movie old movie never heard touch screen navigation clunky console restart repeatedly play movie force watch ad fast forward last point regardless issue feel garuda do good job transform 510 year ago however definitely plenty room improve,Positive
